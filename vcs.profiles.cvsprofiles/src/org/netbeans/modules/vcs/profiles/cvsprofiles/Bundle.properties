OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category=Version Control
OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=Integration of command-line CVS client and Java CVS client into generic VCS support.
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=The CVS Support Profile module enables you to use either the command-line CVS client or the JavaCVS client as a version control system within the IDE. It also enables you to use CVS with other version control systems. If you are only working with CVS, it is recommended that you use the built-in NetBeans 5.0 CVS support. Note that installing this module disables the built-in NetBeans 5.0 CVS support.
