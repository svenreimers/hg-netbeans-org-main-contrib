    Installs a Swing-compatible file chooser optimized for keyboard-only users. \
    Performs GNU Readline-style filename completion when you press Tab. \
    Shows available completions in a list for quick reference, similar to Emacs. \
    Also includes a persistent list of recently used directories for extra speed. \
