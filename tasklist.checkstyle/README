This module provides integration with the Checkstyle library,
available from checkstyle.sf.net.

Due to licensing issues, those bits are not hosted here,
so you'll need to download it yourself, and locate
checkstyle-X.X.jar inside the installation, then
copy it into the "tasklist/external/checkstyle.jar" directory.

You must also copy into the "tasklist/external" directory antlr.jar,
commons-beanutils-core.jar, commons-cli.jar, and commons-collections.jar.
These are also found in the checkstyle download.

You should also place the checkstyle configuration
file you want to use, for example
  checkstyle-X.X/contrib/examples/conf/BlochEffectiveJava.xml
into external and name it "checkstyle_checks.xml".
