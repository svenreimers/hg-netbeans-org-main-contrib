/**
 * A simple interface for providing a fixed set of panels for a wizard.
 * To use, simply implement <code>createPanel()</code> to create the 
 * appropriate UI component for a given step (a unique String ID - one of the ones passed 
 * in the constructor in the <code>steps</code> array), and implement 
 * <code>finish()</code> to do whatever should be done when the wizard is
 * finished.
 * <p>
 * To control whether the Next/Finish buttons are enabled, components 
 * created in <code>createPanel()</code> should call methods on the <code>
 * WizardController</code> passed.  The created panels should listen on the
 * UI components they create, updating the settings Map when the user changes
 * their input.
 * <p>
 * Super-simple one-pane wizard example - if the checkbox is checked, the user
 * can continue:
 * <pre>
 * public class MyProvider extends WizardPanelProvider {
 *    public MyProvider() {
 *       <font color="gray">//here we pass a localized title for the wizard, 
 *       //the ID of the one step it will have, and a localized description
 *       //the wizard can show for that one step</font>
 *       super ("Click the box", "click", "Click the checkbox");
 *    }
 *    protected abstract JComponent createPanel (final WizardController controller, String id, final Map settings) {
 *       <font color="gray">//A quick sanity check</font>
 *       assert "click".equals (id);
 *       <font color="gray">//Remember this method will only be called <i>once</i> for any panel</font>
 *       final JCheckBox result = new JCheckBox();
 *       result.addActionListener (new ActionListener() {
 *          public void actionPerformed (ActionEvent ae) {
 *             <font color="gray">//Typically you want to write the result of some user 
 *             //action into the settings map as soon as they do it </font>
 *             settings.put ("boxSelected", result.isSelected() ? Boolean.TRUE : Boolean.FALSE);
 *             if (result.isSelected()) {
 *                controller.setProblem(null);
 *             } else {
 *                controller.setProblem("The box is not checked");
 *             }
 *             controller.setCanFinish(true); <font color="gray">//won't matter if we called setProblem() with non-null</font>
 *          }
 *       });
 *       return result;
 *    }
 *
 *    protected abstract Object finish (Map settings) throws WizardException {
 *       <font color="gray">//if we had some interesting information (Strings a user put in a 
 *       //text field or something, we'd generate some interesting object or
 *       //create some files or something here</font>
 *       return null;
