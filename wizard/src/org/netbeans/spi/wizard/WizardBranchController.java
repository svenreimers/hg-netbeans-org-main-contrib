/**
 * Extend this class to create wizards which have branch points in them - 
 * either override <code>getWizardForStep</code> to return one or another a wizard which
 * represents the subsequent steps after a decision point, or override 
 * <code>getPanelProviderForStep</code> to provide instances of <code>WizardPanelProvider</code>
 * if there are no subsequent branch points and the continuation is a 
 * simple wizard.
 * <p>
 * The result is a <code>Wizard</code> which embeds sub-wizards; when the 
 * <code>PanelProvider</code> passed to the constructor runs out of steps,
 * the master <code>Wizard</code> will try to find a sub-<code>Wizard</code>
 * by calling <code>getWizardForStep</code>.  If non-null, the user seamlessly
 * continues in the returned wizard.  To create <code>Wizard</code>s with 
 * multiple branches, simply override <code>getWizardForStep</code> to create
 * another <code>WizardBranchController</code> and return the result of its
 * <code>createWizard</code> method.
 * <p>
 * Note that it is important to cache the instances of <code>WizardPanelProvider</code>
 * or <code>Wizard</code> which are returned here - this class's methods may
 * be called frequently to determine if the sequence of steps (the next wizard)
 * have changed.
