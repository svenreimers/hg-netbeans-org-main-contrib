        <h1>JPDA (Java) Debugger Call Stack View Enhancements</h1>
        <h2>Features </h2>
        This module enhances the Call Stack View of JPDA (Java) Debugger by adding the following columns:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Modifiers</b> - this columns displays the modifiers of the method
            associated with the stack frame.
            <li><b>Method</b> - this columns displays the name, parameters and
            return type of the method associated with the stack frame.
            <li><b>Declaring Class</b> - this column displays the class declaring
            the method associated with the stack frame.
            <li><b>this Class</b> - this column displays the class of
            <code>this</code> variable associated with the non-static stack frame.
            Note: The class <code>this</code> of may be different from the Declaring class.
            <li><b>Location Path</b> - when available this column displays the
            full path of the location of the method associated with the stack frame.
        </ul>
        The call stack view shows the custom icons (similar to Navigator window)
        for constructors and methods with public, protected, private, (package),
        and static qualifiers. This behaviour can be turned off by setting the
        system property -
        <code>-Dorg.netbeans.modules.debugger.callstackviewenhancements.dontShowCustomIcons=true</code>
        <h2>How to use</h2>
        Simply debug any Java application. You should see the above additional
        information in the Call Stack view.
        <p>
        The following popup actions are supported:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Go to type of this</b> - Go to source file of the class of the
            <code>this</code> variable associated with the stack frame if it is
            different from the class that declares the method associated with
            the stack frame.
            <li>A set of <b>Go to type [local variable type]</b> - Go to
            (distinct) declared and actual types of local variables of the method
            associated with the stack frame.
            <li><b>Show Classes...</b> - Show the table of all classes loaded in
            the debugee. Each row in Classes table shows Class name, Package name and the value
            returned by the <code>toString()</code> method of class's ClassLoader.
            This can be useful for debugging applications such as App Servers, IDE
            Frameworks (e.g. Netbeans itself), that employ a complex multi-ClassLoader
            architecture. This view helps you determine which ClassLoader loaded the class.

        <h2>Example</h2>
        The following images shows a Java classes - parent class
        <code>humanresources.Person</code> and sub class
        <code>humanresources.Employee</code> being debugged. The debugger has
        stopped at a line in <code>humanresources.Person</code>'s
        <code>toString()</code> method which has been called from
        <code>humanresources.Employee</code>'s <code>toString()</code> method.

            additional columns and popup actions.
