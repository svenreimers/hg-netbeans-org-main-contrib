        <h1>JPDA (Java) Debugger Call Stack View Enhancements</h1>
        <h2>Features </h2>
        This module enhances the Call Stack View of JPDA (Java) Debugger by
        showing the class of the <code>this</code> variable
        associated with the stack frame if it is different from the class
        that declares the method associated with the stack frame.
        <br>
        The call stack view shows the custom icons (similar to Navigator window)
        for constructors and methods with public, protected, private, (package),
        and static qualifiers. This behaviour can be turned off by setting the
        system property -
        <code>-Dorg.netbeans.modules.debugger.callstackviewenhancements.dontShowCustomIcons=true</code>
        <h2>How to use</h2>
        Simply debug any Java application. You should see the above additional
        information in the Call Stack view.
        <p>
        The following popup actions are supported:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Go to type of this</b> - Go to source file of the class of the
            <code>this</code> variable associated with the stack frame if it is
            different from the class that declares the method associated with
            the stack frame.
            <li>A set of <b>Go to type [local variable type]</b> - Go to
            (distinct) declared and actual types of local variables of the method
            associated with the stack frame.
        </ul>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        The following images shows a Java classes - parent class
        <code>humanresources.Person</code> and sub class 
        <code>humanresources.Employee</code> being debugged. The debugger has
        stopped at a line in <code>humanresources.Person</code>'s 
        <code>toString()</code> method which has been called from
        <code>humanresources.Employee</code>'s <code>toString()</code> method.
        <br>
        <image src="persondotjava.jpg" alt="humanresources.Person Source"><br>
        <image src="employeedotjava.jpg" alt="humanresources.Employee Source"><br>
        <p>
            The following image shows the enahanced Call Stack view.
            Notice that the actual type of <code>this</code> variable of first
            stack frame is <code>humanresources.Employee</code>. Therefore the
            label shows the class of <code>this</code> variable along with the
            class declaring the method associated with the call stack frame. The
            <b>Go to type of this</b> action opens the source file for
            <code>humanresources.Employee</code>.
        </p>
