## This resource bundle is used for localized version of PVCS. Translate this ##
## only when the appropriate localization of PVCS is available.               ##

# To translate this you will need to install the localized version of PVCS
# and fill the localized keys from the output of command-line commands.
# The user will have then two profiles available. One for original English PVCS
# and one for localized PVCS.


# Put the name of your locale instead of word "Localized" (i.e. "PVCS - Japan").
PVCS_Localized_Label=PVCS - Localized
# Add a translated word "English" after this label, so that the user will know,
# that this is for English PVCS. (I.e. translate "PVCS - English")
