<h2><a name="1">1. Jndi Browser</a></h2>
&nbsp; JNDI Browser allows user to add new directory contexts, browse them, and
 generate code usable in developed actions. Using the JNDI support module,
 you can mount JNDI hierarchies from any JNDI 1.2 compliant provider in the
 NetBeans Explorer and browse it. 
<h3><a name="1.1">1.1 Code Generation</a></h3> &nbsp;
 User is able to generate lookup code to Clipboard from each Object in the&nbsp;
 directory context hierarchy or binding code from Context objects by selecting&nbsp;
 the desired node and choosing the copy action from pop up menu. &nbsp; <h4><a name="1.1">1.2 Provider Templates</a></h4> &nbsp;
 &nbsp; JNDI Browser contains one special folder, that contains provider templates.&nbsp;
 Provider template node represents installed provider. The values of properties&nbsp;
 specified in the provider template are used as default values when the corresponding&nbsp;
 provider is used for connecting to directory service. User can create new&nbsp;
 provider template, delete template, modify template, test or use it.<br> &nbsp;
 &nbsp; When user creates new provider template for newly installed provider&nbsp;
 the dialog for specifying provider properties appears, in this dialog user&nbsp;
 fills the standard JNDI properties as well as additional proprietal properties&nbsp;
 required by provider.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; By selecting provider and choosing Customize
 from pop up menu the same&nbsp; dialog as in create appears and is filled by
 current values, user can modify&nbsp; these values. The values can be also modified
 directly in property sheet&nbsp; of corresponding provider.<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="1.1">1.3 Object Properties</a></h4> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; For directory
 services that allows properties on bound objects, such as LDAP, browser
 supports special additional property sheet, where user can, if access to
 this object is read/write, modify values of these properties. User is also
 able to add, remove or modify these properties by selecting node and choosing
 customize from pop up menu. <br>
