<h2>Generating Code With JNDI</h2>
<p>
The Java Naming Directory Interface<sup><small>TM</small></sup> (JNDI)
helps you write programs that use JNDI to access naming services
technology. The main feature is a JNDI browser, which you can use to
browse the contents of a naming or directory service that is running
on your local machine or elsewhere on the network.  In the browser,
you can see the objects that have been registered with the naming or
directory service and generate binding or lookup code for them.  You
can include this code in a program that needs to access the naming
service through JNDI.
</p>
<p>
The JNDI browser is represented by the JNDI node, which appears in the
Runtime tab in the Explorer window.  Expanding this node shows the JNDI
service providers that have been installed.
