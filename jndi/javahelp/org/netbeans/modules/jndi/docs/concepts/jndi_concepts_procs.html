<h2>
Using the JNDI Module</h2>
The JNDI module generates most of the code that a Java class needs to access
a naming or directory service via JNDI. The procedures for using the module
to generate code you can use in a program are outlined below:
<ol>
<li>
Determine what you are trying to accomplish. The questions you need to
answer include:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Which naming or directory service are you trying to access?</li>

<li>
Which JNDI service provider do you need to access that service?</li>

<li>
Will your application be looking up entries or binding new entries?</li>

<li>
What connection information do you need to access the naming or directory
service, such as URL, username, password, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Access the naming or directory service with the JNDI module's JNDI Browser.
The browser will represent the contents of the service as a tree of nodes
in the IDE.</li>

<li>
Using the browser, navigate through the naming or directory service, and
locate the item you want to look up or the context in which you want to
bind a new entry.</li>

<li>
Using the browser's context menu, generate lookup or binding code. Paste
it into your program.</li>

<li>
Run and test your programs.</li>
</ol>
