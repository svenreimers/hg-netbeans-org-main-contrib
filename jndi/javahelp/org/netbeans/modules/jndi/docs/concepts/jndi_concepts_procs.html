<h2>Steps for Generating Code With JNDI</h2>
<p>
The JNDI module generates most of the code that a Java class needs to access
a naming or directory service via JNDI. The procedures for using the module
to generate code you can use in a program are outlined below:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine what you are trying to accomplish. The questions you need to
answer include:
<ul>
<li>Which naming or directory service are you trying to access?</li>

<li>Which JNDI service provider do you need to access that service?</li>

<li>Will your application be looking up entries or binding new entries?</li>

<li>What connection information do you need to access the naming or directory
service, such as URL, username, password, and so on.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Access the naming or directory service with the JNDI Browser.
The browser will represent the contents of the service as a tree of nodes
in the IDE.</li>

<li>Using the browser, navigate through the naming or directory service, and
locate the item you want to look up or the context in which you want to
bind a new entry.</li>

<li>Using the browser's context menu, generate lookup or binding code. Paste
it into your program.</li>

<li>Run and test your programs.</li>
</ol>
