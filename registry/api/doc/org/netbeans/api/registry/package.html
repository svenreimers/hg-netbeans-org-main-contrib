The Registry API provides unified access to settings.

<h2><a name="Overview"></a>API Overview</h2>
The API has the concept of <span style="font-style: italic;">context</span> which consists of a set
of&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">name-to-object bindings</span>.
It contains methods for examining and updating these bindings. The
contexts are composed into <span style="font-style: italic;">hierarchical
collection</span> which form configuration system. The configuration
system allows applications to store and retrieve data. How data are
stored is implementation detail of backing storage.<br>

<h2><a name="Learn_by_example"></a>Learn by example<br>
</h2>
For API clients it in practice means:<br>
<br>
1.) Decide on the unique name of the context for a group of related
settings, eg:<br>
<br>
<code>String ctxName = "<span style="font-weight: bold;">/Settings/org/netbeans/modules/fooModule/barSettings</span>";<br>
</code><br>
It is recommended to use the module's code name base in the name of the context to ensure uniqueness.<br>
<br>
2.) Create the context for this unique name:<br>
<br>
<code>Context ctx = <span style="font-weight: bold;">Context.getDefault().createSubcontext</span>(ctxName);</code>
<br>
or you can retrieve context if you know it exists:<br>
<br>
<code>Context ctx = <span style="font-weight: bold;">Context.getDefault().getSubcontext</span>(ctxName);<br>
</code><br>
3.) Read and/store settings in the context as needed:<br>
<br>
You have two choices. First is to read/store only primitivy data types:<br>
<br>
<code>String proxyServer = ctx<span style="font-weight: bold;">.getString</span>("proxyServer", <span style="font-weight: bold;">""</span>);<br>
int proxyPort = ctx<span style="font-weight: bold;">.getInt</span>("proxyPort", <span style="font-weight: bold;">8080</span>);<br>
boolean proxyInUse = ctx<span style="font-weight: bold;">.getBoolean</span>("proxyInUse", <span style="font-weight: bold;">false</span>);<br>
</code><br>
The last parameters in all calls is default value which will be
returned if there is no value stored in the registry or if for some reason operation of reading of stored
data failed. It is up to client to provide some reasonable default which
will allow application to still work although there is no default configured.<br>
<br>
Similarly writing could look like:<br>
<br>
<code><span style="font-weight: bold;">ctx.putString</span>("proxyServer", "someproxy.com");<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ctx.putInt</span>("proxyPort", 1080</code><code>);<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ctx.putBoolean</span>("proxyInUse", true</code><code>);<br>
</code><br>
The second choice is to read/store directly <span style="font-style: italic;">Objects</span> in registry:<br>
<br>
<code>ProxyConfiguration proxy = (ProxyConfiguration)<span style="font-weight: bold;">ctx.getObject</span>("proxy", defaultInstance);<br></code><br>
and writting:<br>
<br>
<code><span style="font-weight: bold;">ctx.putObject</span>("proxy",
new ProxyConfiguration("someproxy.com", 1080, true));<br></code><br>
However in this case the client must also solve how the object will be
persisted. The object persistence is not in the scope of Registry API.
It is up to implementation of backing storage and its documentation must
be consulted. It is expected that backing storage should by default handle
all common types of objects like String, Integer, Long, Color, Font,
URL, etc. and for client's objects it should provide a way how to
persist them, e.g. Java Serialization or other mechanism.<br>

<h2><a name="Registry_API_in_detail"></a>Registry API in detail</h2>
The API classes can be split into these categories:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The Context class. This is the heart of the Registry API.
Clients will use the class to manipulate the settings. The Context
class contains getters and setters for most of the common data types
including the primitivy data types. All method signatures contain
defaultValue parameter which is returned if no value was found in
registry. Besides that there are methods for enumerating subcontexts,
bindings and attributes; methods for manipulation with them; support
for ordered listing of context items and their sorting; support for
reverting of modifications to default state if Registry backend has
concept of defaults; method for obtaining default context on top of the default filesystem; etc.</li>
  <li>The ContextListener (and its events: SubcontextEvent, BindingEvent and
AttributeEvent) can be used to learn about changes on the context.</li><li>The
Registry API is thread save. It can be called form arbitrary threads
and it will internally properly synchronize them. The API has getter
for Mutex which clients can used to do several changes in one step.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Distinguishing events</h2>
It might be needed to distinguish events resulted from your context
modifications and events results from foreign modifications. The events
are fired synchronously from the write mutex. That means that at time
when your code is leaving write mutex are all listeners already
notified about the change(s). Following code snippet illustrate the
typical usage how to take advantage of this to distinguish the events:<br>
<br>
<code><span style="font-weight: bold;">private static boolean doingMyChanges = false;
</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Context myContext = ... ;<br>
<br>
myContext.getMutex().writeAccess( new Runnable() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public void run() {<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doingMyChanges = true;
</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; try {
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; doMyChangeHere();
</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } finally {
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; doingMyChanges = false;
</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
});<br>
<br>
<br>
// in implementation of your ContextListener you then do<br>
// ...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public void bindingChanged(...) {
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (doingMyChanges) {
</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return;
</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // handle foreign changes...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
<br>
</code><code>// ...<br>
</code><br>
