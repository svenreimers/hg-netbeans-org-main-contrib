/**
 * This interface represents a basic context which consists of a set of
 * name-to-object bindings. It contains methods for examining and
 * updating these bindings. The contexts are composed into
 * hierarchical collection which form configuration system. The
 * configuration system allows applications to store and retrieve
 * data.
 *
 * <p>The hierarchical collection of contexts is similar to folders
 * in a hierarchical file system. There exist a root context containing
 * all the contexts. The name of this context is <i>"/"</i>
 * and it is also absolute name of the context. The names 
 * of individual contexts cannot be empty, but does not have to 
 * be unique. However, absolute name of the context must be
 * unique. Children of the root context have absolute names of 
 * <i>"/" + context name</i>. All other contexts have absolute names of 
 * <i>parent's context absolute name + "/" + context name</i>.
 *
 * <p>All of the methods that modify context data are permitted to 
 * store changes asynchronously; they may fire change events
 * and return immediatelly and propagate changes to backing store lazily.
 *
 * <p>At minimum the implementation must support persistence of
 * all primitive data types and basic object types for which there
 * are getters and setters in {@link org.netbeans.api.registry.Context} class.
 * It is also recommended to provide a way for storage of other Object types
 * (for example by using Java Serialization or other mechanism for 
 * persistence of objects). If provided it must be properly documented 
 * and explained to clients.
 *
 * <p>The context can contain the subcontext and binding with the same name
 * and they will coexist without problems.
 *
 * <p>TBD: Names restrictions: length, valid characters, etc. 
 * The context name nor binding name cannot contain "/" character. 
 * 
 * <p>See also {@link ResettableContext} which is
 * extensions of the basic context and {@link org.netbeans.api.registry.Context}
 * which is API for bindings manipulation.
