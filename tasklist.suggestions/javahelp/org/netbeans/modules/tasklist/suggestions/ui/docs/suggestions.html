<h2> Suggestions </h2>
The <a href="http://tasklist.netbeans.org"><b>suggestions</b></a>
module, which lists suggestions for your code, such as ideas for how
compiler errors can be fixed, lists unused code, suggests copyrights
whose year ranges need to be updated, etc. <br>
<br>
This feature is still being designed and implemented.
Check out http://tasklist.netbeans.org and the
dev@tasklist.netbeans.org mailing list to get informed
and provide feedback.
<p>The "Suggestions View" shows a list of suggestions generated
by various pieces in the IDE. For example, there is a copyright
checker which makes sure that if there is a copyright string
near the top of the source file, the current year is included,
and if that is not the case, it provides a suggestion that it
is fixed. In many cases, the suggestions can be fixed automatically,
by simply double clicking on the suggestion. </p>
<p>The Suggestions View typically shows suggestions for the
current source file. However, if you select a directory
in the explorer and go to the Tools menu, you can
run the <b>Scan Directory for Suggestions</b> action. This
will recursively process all source files in the directory
and list suggestions for these in a separate view. This
is a convenient way to for example fix the copyright years
on all your source files. Note that you can shift select
all the suggestions and right click to select <b>Fix...</b>,
and now you will iterate through all the suggestions.
</p>
<p>Creating these suggestions often involve a lot of processing.
By default, this processing happens every time you edit a
source file (after a short delay). You can change this such
that suggestion scanning only occurs when you save a file.
You can also simply hide the Suggestions View temporarily if
you want to free up the CPU for something else (such as running
an ant task), since processing only occurs when the Suggestions
View is visible. You can also customize how long the suggestion
scanner should wait after an edit before starting a scan.
You can find these options by selecting "Edit Categories..." in
the context menu in the Suggestions View.
</p>
<p>The following is a list of suggestion providers you might
have available. Modules can add more suggestion providers, so this list
may not be complete.
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Java Compilation Errors. Lists all the java compilation errors
encountered while background-parsing the current source file. It will
also fix suggestions for how the errors can be fixed. For example, it
may suggest that a particular import statement is added, or the
capitalization of an identifier may be changed, or a new method
created. </li>
  <li> Rule Checking. Using the PMD utility, it checks the source file
for violations of rules. This will for example list unused methods,
empty if blocks, etc. </li>
  <li> Javadoc Errors. Lists all methods in the current file that have
errors in their javadoc. The javadoc may be missing, or the parameter
list incomplete, or a @return missing, etc. Allows some of these to be
corrected automatically. </li>
  <li> HTML Errors. Lists errors and warnings in your HTML, XML and JSP
documents, such as missing ALT tags, mismatched tags, etc. Allows the
document to be cleaned up and reformatted automatically. </li>
  <li> Copyright Errors. Lists copyright items where the year or year
range does not include the current year. Allows these to be corrected
automatically. </li>
  <li> Due Tasks. Lists tasks in the user task view that are already
due or will become due in the next 36 hours (e.g. roughly today or
tomorrow). </li>
  <li> Source Tasks. Lists tasks found in the source file, where a task
is an entry in a comment marked by FIXME, TODO or XXX. </li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Fixing a Suggestion</h3>
Some tasks have associated Fix operations. When that is the case,
double clicking on the suggestion will bring up the Fix Confirmation
Dialog. The Fix confirmation dialog varies from suggestion to
suggestion, but typically it provides details describing exactly
what applying Fix is going to change - and gives you a Cancel button
if you change your mind.
<p>You can select multiple suggestions at once (using the Shift key
or the Control key), and then right click and select Fix. This
will apply Fix to each item in the selection list, which provides
you with a quick way to apply a number of suggestions. When multiple
suggestions have been selected, the confirmation dialog includes
a "Fix All" button which bypasses the confirmation step for each
suggestion and simply performs the suggestions quietly. It will
also have a "Skip" button you can use to skip one particular
suggestion and move to the next.
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Show Source Code</h3>
Whenever a confirmation dialog is shown for a suggestion, its
associated file position is also shown in the editor. If a
suggestion does not have an automatic fix operation, the
default operation on double click is to show the source position.
For suggestions with automatic fix, you can right click and
select "Go To Source" to show the source position for a suggestion.
<h3>Filtering Suggestions</h3>
If you want to limit your focus to suggestions of one particular
category, use the "Show" action in the Suggestions View context menu.
It lists the categories of suggestions, such as "Java Compilation
Errors". When you select one of these, only suggestions in that
category are shown (and more importantly, the other categories are no
longer processed, so your computer doesn't have to work as hard.)
If you want to get back to showing all suggestions, simply select
"All" from the Show menu.
<h3>Disabling Suggestions</h3>
If you are not interested in a particular category of suggestions, such
as
"Copyright Problems", you can disable it. This will make your
suggestions view less cluttered since it only lists suggestions
you are interested in. To disable a category, right click on
a suggestion and select "Disable Category". You can also
show the "Edit Categories..." dialog - and this is what you have
to do if you want to bring back a category you have previously
disabled.
<!-- TODO Show dialog screenshot here -->The "Edit Categories" dialog
lists the available categories
as rows in a table. Additional columns allow you to enable/disable
each category, and for those that are enabled, turn off
confirmation dialogs when the suggestion is performed.
When confirmation is disabled for a category, selecting
"Fix..." on a suggestion will perform the fix without showing
the confirmation dialog.
<p><b>Important</b>: Note that disabling a category applies to
all suggestions of that particular category. For example,
if there is a particular rule suggestion you don't want
to see, such as "unused import", disabling it means that
ALL rule suggestions are disabled, not just this particular
rule. To customize which rules are run, right click
and select "Edit Rules...". </p>
<p>Finally, the dialog allows you to control the scanning behavior
of sourcefile-oriented suggestions. You can choose to have
the suggestion list updated whenever the document is edited,
or just when the document is saved. You can also change the
scanning delay to be more or less aggressive. The scanning
delay is the time interval that the suggestions view will
wait after a file edit or file save before it starts checking
the source for suggestions.
</p>
<h3>Category-specific Help</h3>
<ul>
  <li> The Java Compilation Errors are cued off of the java module's
parser - so it ignores the save-vs-edit behavior.
    <p> This module also depends on the specific English error strings
created by the compiler. If somehow you are running the compiler in a
different locale, this may break the module. This should be fixed by
JSR-199 when that becomes available. </p>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li> The Rule Violations suggestions provide automatic fix performers
for unused imports, duplicate imports, and unused fields. Not all
unused fields have automatic fixers, since in some cases doing it
automatically might be risky.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li> The Javadoc error does not handle parameter renaming well. In
particular, let's say that you had a method with a single parameter
named "foo", and you documented this with a "@param foo" javadoc tag.
Then you've renamed the parameter to "bar" and forgot to update the
javadoc. The javadoc scanner will not realize that "@param foo" is
referring to parameter "bar", so you will get two errors: no javadoc
for "bar", and javadoc for a nonexistent parameter "foo". When you
autofix this javadoc, it will create a new empty javadoc tag for "bar",
and remove the javadoc tag for "foo", instead of renaming (and
persisting) the existing javadoc.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li> The Javadoc error provider will list separate suggestions for
separate problems found in a method's javadoc. However, running Fix on
the suggestion will fix ALL the problems in the javadoc in a single
operation. You cannot fix one individual problem automatically.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li> The HTML error provider works on HTML files, XML files and JSP
files. The errors are provided by the "Tidy" utility behind the scenes.
It was mostly written for HTML files so it is not clear how useful the
errors are in XML or JSP files.
    <p> In the context menu, you can find a "Cleanup/Rewrite" action.
When you select this, your entire document will be cleaned up (meaning
wrong tags moved or removed, etc.) and reformatted. By selecting the
Preview button in the dialog, you can get a before-and-after diff of
the changes performed. </p>
    <p> You can run this action on documents that don't have
suggestions as well. Select the given HTML document, and then look in
the Tools menu - the action should be there. </p>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li> You can customize the tokens that are used to locate source code
tasks: XXX, TODO, FIXME. Go to the Options dialog and select "Task List
Editor Support"; you will find a setting named "Scan Regular
Expression". This is a regular expression your source comments are
matched against.
