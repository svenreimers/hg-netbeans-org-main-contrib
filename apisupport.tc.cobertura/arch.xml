   Cobertura Module Test Coverage provides Ant scripts to measure test coverage
   of NetBeans Module and Suite projects. It needs Module Build Harness to run.

            Please express your estimates of how long the design, implementation,
            stabilization are likely to last. How many people will be needed to
            implement this and what is the expected milestone by which the work should be

            Some non-NetBeans projects are packaged as NetBeans modules
            (see <a href="http://libs.netbeans.org/">libraries</a>) and
            it is preferred to use this approach when more modules may
            depend on such third-party library.

        <question id="deploy-jar" when="impl">
            Do you deploy just module JAR file(s) or other files as well?
            <hint>
            Usually a module consist of one JAR file (perhaps with Class-Path
            extensions) and also a configuration file that enables it. If you
            have any other files, use
            &lt;api group="java.io.File" name="yourname" type="export" category="friend"&gt;...&lt;/api&gt;
            to define the location, name and stability of your files (of course
            changing "yourname" and "friend" to suit your needs).
            
            If it uses more than one JAR, describe where they are located, how
            they refer to each other. 
            If it consist of module JAR(s) and other files, please describe
            what is their purpose, why other files are necessary. Please 
            make sure that installation/uninstallation leaves the system 
            in state as it was before installation.

            <hint>

   Yes, Cobertura is run in separate processes due to GPL license it uses.

            If there is a property that can change the behavior of your 
            code, somebody will likely use it. You should describe what it does 
            and the <a href="http://openide.netbeans.org/tutorial/api-design.html#life">stability category</a>
            of this API. You may use

 <answer id="exec-property">
  <p>
   There is a bug which prevents Cobertura tasks to run on different JVM than Ant.
   When running on NB.org module project (part of NetBeans sources) it is 
   advisable to use:
	<pre>
	nbjdk.home.defaulted=true
	permit.jdk6.builds=true
	</pre>
	which ensures that tests are run within the same JVM (as of NB 6.8).
