<h1>Win32 loader for Forte for Java Internet Edition rmid wrapper</h1>
<!--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-->
<p>
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<blockquote>
<code>rmid_wrapper.exe [options]</code>
</blockquote>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

rmid wrapper is a wrapper for JDK rmid. It provides additional
functionality that can be used from the IDE.  rmid_wrapper.exe is a 
console application. When it is run, there is a
console opened on the desktop with stderr and stdout output from the Java
program. You can type Ctrl-Break to get the thread dump or type Ctrl-C to
kill the whole program.

<p>
The rmid_wrapper uses java.exe to launch the wrapper.

You can specify additional options. They are

<dl>
      
  <dt><code>-jdkhome <i>jdk_home_dir</i></code></dt>
  <dd>use the specified JDK version instead of the default one. By default the
      loader looks into the Windows registry and uses the latest JDK available.
      <p>
  </dd>

</dl>

All options and arguments are recognized in the same manner as rmid 
recognizes them. There are a few predefined options:

<dl>
 <dt>-Dnetbeans.security.policy=rmid.policy</dt>
 <dd>the wrapper uses default 
 policy file. It could be replaced by another one but there is one
 major grant entry that should be part of the policy file:

 <code><pre>
 grant codeBase "file:${netbeans.home}/-" {
   permission java.security.AllPermission;
 };
 </pre></code>
 it gives enough permission to the wrapper class. The classes are
 located in {netbeans.home}/lib/ext/rmi-ext.jar
 
 </dd>
 <dt>-classpath</dt>
  <dd>{netbeans.home}/lib/ext/rmi-ext.jar is added to the
 classpath
   </dd>
 
 <dt>-Dsun.rmi.server.activation.debugExec</dt>
  <dd>is set to True
  </dd>
 <dt>-Dnetbeans.home<dt>
   <dd>is set to <code>{directory_of_wrapper_process}\..</code>
   </dd>
</dl>

The options above can be redefined (using the -J switch).

<h2>About arguments containing spaces</h2>

If arguments like classpath or properties contain spaces, they must be enclosed
in double quotes. Write two successive quotes to denote a quote inside an
argument: for example, &quot;3 1/2 &quot;&quot; floppy drive&quot;.


<h2>Examples</h2>
To change security policy:
<blockquote><code>rmid_wrapper.exe -J-Djava.security.policy=policy</code></blockquote>

To turn off debugging information:
<blockquote><code>rmid_wrapper.exe -J-Dsun.rmi.server.activation.debugExec=false</code></blockquote>
