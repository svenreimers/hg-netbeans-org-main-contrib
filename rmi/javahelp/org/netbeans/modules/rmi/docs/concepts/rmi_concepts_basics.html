<h2>RMI Technology</h2>
<p>
The RMI technology enables a Java object in one process to call the methods
of a Java object running in another process. The basic parts of programs
that use this technology are shown in the following

  </OBJECT></p>

<p>The role that each part plays in an RMI program is summarized below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Client Class.</b> Invokes a business method, which is executed in the
server process. A complete client-side application might consist
of more classes than the RMI client class.</li>

<li>
<b>Stub Classes.</b> Used on the client side, they convert the client class'
method invocation into a format that can be delivered over a network connection.
They perform the same function for values that are returned from the server
side, converting them back into the client's language format.</li>

<li>
<b>RMI Runtime Classes.</b> Manage the transmission and delivery of method invocations
between processes.
</li>

<li>
<b>Implementation Class.</b> Contains the server's business logic, which clients
execute by remote method invocation. The RMI module generates implementation
classes that create instances of themselves and export those instances
to the RMI runtime. The implementation class also takes a reference to
the exported instance and makes it publicly available by registering it
with an RMI registry.
</li>

<li>
<b>Skeleton Classes.</b> Used on the server side; convert a method invocation
from the wire format generated by the stub classes and transmitted by the
RMI runtime into a format that can be read by the server-side instance.
</li>
</ul>
