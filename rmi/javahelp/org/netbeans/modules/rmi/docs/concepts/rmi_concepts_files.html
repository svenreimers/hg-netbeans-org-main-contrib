<h2>Required Files for RMI Programs</h2>
<p>
The RMI module has several RMI templates available from the New
Wizard. You can use the templates to generate Java source files
(<code>.java</code> files) for the different parts of RMI
programs. The kind of RMI program you are writing determines the files
you need to generate.
</p>
<h3>Remote Interface Files</h3>
<p>
Remote interface files are Java interfaces that extend
<code>java.rmi.Remote</code>. The remote interface defines the
interface of an RMI server. It is compiled to create the stub and
skeleton files that enable a client and a server to communicate. On the
server side, you need a remote interface in the package with your
implementation class. On the client side, you need to know the method
signatures declared in the remote interface, because your client will
be invoking these methods. You also need a remote interface, which is
required for compiling.
</p>
<p>You can use an existing remote interface or you can write your own:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you are writing a client program that uses RMI technology to access
an RMI server that someone else has already developed and deployed, you
must begin with a copy of the remote interface that declares the server-side
methods that your client program can invoke.</li>

<li>
If you are developing an RMI server or a complete RMI application, you
begin by writing your own remote interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The RMI templates include a template named Remote that generates
a remote interface that you complete in the IDE's editing window. The template
wizard provides support for writing a remote interface, it provides
you with dialog boxes that enable you to add interface elements in correct syntax.
</p>
<h3>Client-side Files</h3>
<p>
The files you need for a client-side program are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>A client class.</b> You can generate a client class with the template named
RMIClient. After generating a client class, complete its <tt>main()</tt>
method by adding logic that looks up a reference to the RMI server from
an RMI registry and uses the reference to invoke server methods.</li>

<li>
<b>The stub classes.</b> RMI technology makes it possible for the
client program to obtain stub files at run time, after it performs the
registry lookup.  Stub classes can be present on the client side or
they can be dynamically downloaded.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you are writing a client program to access an existing RMI server,
you need a copy of the remote interface, which contains method
signatures for the server-side methods your program can invoke.
</p>
<h3>Server-side Files</h3>
<p>
The files you need for a server-side program are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>An implementation class.</b> This class contains implementations of
the methods declared in the remote interface.  These implementation
classes contain the business logic that can be executed by clients.
<p>
The RMI module generates implementation classes that include their
own startup code. This means that they create instances of themselves,
export themselves, and register themselves with an RMI registry. You can
generate an implementation class with the RMI templates.
</p>
<p>
After generating an implementation class, you need to write the business
logic. If your business logic is complex, you can supplement the public
methods declared in the remote interface with private methods that are
invoked by the declared remote methods.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>The skeleton classes.</b> These classes are generated when you
compile the remote interface. Skeleton classes are not required in
Java 2 SDK v/.2 or compatible versions.</li> 
</ul>
<p>
If you are using the RMI templates to generate your server-side files, you
should generate and complete a remote interface (or obtain a copy of an
existing interface) before generating the other server-side files.
