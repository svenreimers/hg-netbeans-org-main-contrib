<h2>
Using the RMI Module</h2>
The RMI module generates most of the source code you need for RMI client
and server programs. This is not, however, a one-step process, and the
procedures you follow to create RMI programs are outlined below:
<ol>
<li>
Obtain or write the remote interface that defines the interfaces for your
RMI programs. If you are using non-group RMI templates to generate server-side
code, generate your remote interface first. If you are using group templates or the RMI wizard
to generate server-side code, you can use the wizard to both write your
remote interface and generate program files based on the interface.</li>

<li>
Decide which Java source files you need generated, client-side, server-side,
or both.</li>

<li>
Use either the RMI wizard or the RMI templates to generate the files.</li>

<li>
Add the code that completes the generated files:</li>

<ul>
<li>
On the client side, add code that contacts an RMI Registry and looks up
a reference for an RMI server. When the RMI server is running, you can
use the RMI module's Registry Browser to generate this code for you.</li>

<li>
On the server side, add code that implements the methods declared in the
remote interface.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Compile the package. On the server side this includes the remote interface.</li>

<li>
Run and test your programs.</li>
</ol>
