Introduction to the RMI Module</h2>
The RMI module helps you write programs that use RMI technology. It includes
an RMI wizard and RMI templates, either of which can generate most of the
code needed for RMI programs. It also includes a RMI Registry browser that
generates the code for RMI registry binding and lookup.
