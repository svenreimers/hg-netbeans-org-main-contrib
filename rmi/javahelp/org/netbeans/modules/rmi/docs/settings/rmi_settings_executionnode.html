<h2>RMI Execution Settings</h2>
<p>
You can see the execution mode that has been assigned to a class by
looking at the property sheet for the class. (The property sheet's
Execution tab has an Executor property.)  When you run a class, its
Executor property is used to start the Java virtual machine in which
the class runs.
</p>
<p>
You can customize the RMI executor properties.  When you change the
value of a property, your change affects all classes that use that
executor.

<p>
To customize the RMI Execution settings:
<ol>
  <li>Choose Tools <img src="../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choose">&nbsp;Options 
    from the main window.</li>
  <li>Expand the node for Debugging and Executing.</li>
  <li>Expand the node for Execution Types and select an RMI executor.</li>
</ol>


<p>
The Properties tab contains the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>External Process.</b>
A <tt>java</tt> command with appropriate parameters for RMI execution.
When you run a class, this command is used to start the Java virtual
machine in which the class will run. Each of the RMI executor nodes
has a slightly different set of parameters.
</li>
<li><b>Identifying Name.</b>
The name that represents the execution mode defined by the
settings. Each of the RMI executor nodes has a different identifying
name. The name appears in the individual class Executor settings.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Expert tab contains the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>Append Environment Variable.</b>
If true, appends or replaces existing IDE environment variables, such
as <tt>Classpath</tt> with
the variables listed in the Environment Variable property.
</li>
<li><b>Boot Classpath.</b>
The class path used to locate the java executable for running an RMI class.
</li>
<li><b>Classic Switch.</b>
If True, use the classic Java virtual machine.
</li>
<li><b>Classpath.</b>
The class path supplied to the process that runs the RMI class. The
path includes the project directory you are working in and any other
filesystems you mounted for the project.
</li>
<li><b>Environment Variables.</b>
A list of environment variables in the form <i>name = value</i>.  If you
specify null, the IDE's settings are used.
</li>
<li><b>Filesystems IP URL.</b>
The HTTP address for the IDE's Filesystems node, using the local host's IP
address.
</li>
<li><b>Filesystems Path.</b>
The path for all Filesystems nodes, including filesystems that you
have mounted. 
</li>
<li><b>Filesystems URL.</b>
The HTTP address for the IDE's Filesystems node, using the local host's name.
</li>
<li><b>Host IP.</b>
The IP address of the local host.
</li>
<li><b>Host Name.</b>
The name of the local host.
</li>
<li><b>Internal HTTP Port.</b>
