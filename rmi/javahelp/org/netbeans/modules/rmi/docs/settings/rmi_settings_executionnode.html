<h2>
RMI Executor Nodes Settings</h2>
The Execution Types node (on the Project Settings dialog) has six subnodes
for execution modes that are related to RMI:
<ul>
<li>
RMI Executor</li>

<li>
RMI Unicast Export (debug)</li>

<li>
RMI Client Executor</li>

<li>
RMI Unicast Export</li>

<li>
RMI Client Executor (debug)</li>

<li>
RMI Executor (debug)</li>
</ul>
Each of these nodes represents a slightly different execution mode for
RMI programs. When you generate a class with the RMI templates or the RMI
wizard, one of these execution modes is specified for it. You can see the
execution mode that has been specified for a class by looking at the class's
property sheet. (The property sheet's Execution tab has an Executor property.)
When you run a class, its Executor property is used to start the Java virtual
mahine in which the class will run.
<p>The settings for each of these Executor nodes define one execution environment.
<h3>
Properties Tab</h3>

<h4>
External Process</h4>
A <tt>java</tt> command with appropriate parameters for RMI execution.
When you run a class, this command is used to start the Java virtual machine
in which the class will run. Each of the RMI executor nodes has a slightly
different set of parameters.
<h4>
Identifying Name</h4>
This name represents the execution mode defined by the settings. Each of
the RMI executor nodes has a different identifying name. This is the name
the appears in the individual class Executor settings.
<h3>

address.
<h4>
