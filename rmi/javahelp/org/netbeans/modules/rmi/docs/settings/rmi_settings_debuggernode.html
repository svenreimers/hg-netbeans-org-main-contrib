<h2>
RMI Debugging Node Settings</h2>
This node represents an execution mode for debugging RMI programs. When
you generate a class with the RMI templates or the RMI wizard, this execution
mode is specified for debugging. You can see the debugging mode that has
been specified for a class by looking at the class's property sheet. (The
property sheet's Execution tab has an Debugger property.) When you debug
an RMI class, its Debugger property is used to start the Java virtual machine
in which the debugger will run.
<p>The settings for this node define the execution environment for debugging
RMI programs.
<h3>
Properties Tab</h3>

<h4>
Classic Switch</h4>
Specifies whether or not to use the "classic" Java virtual machine.
<h4>
External Process</h4>
A <tt>java</tt> command with parameters appropriate for RMI debugging.
When you debug a class whose Debugger property is set to RMI Debugging,
the IDE will use this command will start up the execution environment.
<h4>
Hostname</h4>
The hostname on which the RMI Debugging process will run. Defaults to the
local host.
<h4>
Identifying Name</h4>
A name for the execution mode defined with these property settings. The
default value is "RMI Stub Compiler." When this name appears in a class's
property sheet, the IDE uses the execution mode associated with the name.
<h4>
Implementation</h4>
Specifies which debugger implementation to run when an RMI class is debugged.
<h3>
Expert Tab</h3>

<h4>
Boot Class Path</h4>
Class path used to locate the java executable for the debugging process.
<h4>
Class path</h4>
The class path supplied to the RMI Debugging process. Includes the project
directory you are working in and any other filesystems you mounted for
the project.
<h4>
Filesystems IP URL</h4>
The HTTP address for the IDE's Filesystems node, using local host's IP
address.
<h4>
Filesystems Path</h4>
Path for all Filesystems nodes, including filesystems that you have mounted.
<h4>
Filesystems URL</h4>
The HTTP address for the IDE's Filesystems node, using local host's name.
<h4>
Host IP</h4>
The IP address of the local host.
<h4>
Internal HTTP Port</h4>
The port used by the IDE's internal HTTP server.
<h4>
Library Path</h4>
Path for libraries available to the IDE, including any that you have mounted.
<h4>
Working Directory</h4>
Working directory for the debugging process. Defaults to "null."
