<h2>RMI Debugging Settings</h2>
<p>
The RMI Debugging node represents an execution mode for debugging RMI
programs. When you generate a class with the RMI templates or the RMI
wizard, the RMI debugging mode is assigned by default. You can see the
debugging mode that has been assigned for a class by looking at the
class's property sheet. (The property sheet's Execution tab has a
Debugger property.)  When you debug an RMI class, this property is
used to start the Java virtual machine in which the debugger runs.
</p>
<p>
You can customize the properties that define the execution environment
for debugging RMI programs.  When you change the value of a property,
your change affects all classes that use that debugging mode.
</p>

<p>
To customize the RMI Debugging setting:
<ol>
  <li>Choose Tools <img src="../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choose">&nbsp;Options 
    from the main window.</li>
  <li>Expand the node for Debugging and Executing.</li>
  <li>Expand the node for Debugging Types and select RMI Debugging.</li>
</ol>


<p>
The Properties tab contains the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>Classic Switch.</b>
If True, use the classic Java virtual machine.
</li>
<li>
<b>External Process.</b>
A <tt>java</tt> command with parameters appropriate for RMI debugging.
When you debug a class whose Debugger property is set to RMI Debugging,
the IDE uses this command to start up the execution environment.
</li>
<li><b>Host Name.</b>
The host name on which the RMI debugging process runs. The default
is the <tt>localhost</tt>.
</li>
<li><b>Identifying Name.</b>
The name for the execution mode defined with these property settings. The
default value is RMI Debugging. When this name appears in a class's
property sheet, the IDE uses the execution mode associated with the name.
</li>
<li><b>Implementation.</b>
The debugger implementation to run when debugging an RMI class.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The Expert tab contains the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>Boot Class Path.</b>
The class path to use to locate the Java executable for the debugging process.
</li>
  <li> <b>Class Path.</b> The class path supplied to the RMI debugging process. 
    The path includes the project directory you are working in and any other filesystems 
    you mounted for the project. </li>
<li>
<b>Filesystems IP URL.</b>
The HTTP address for the IDE's Filesystems node, using the
local host's IP address.
</li>
<li><b>Filesystems Path.</b>
The path for all Filesystems nodes, including filesystems that you
have mounted. 
</li>
<li><b>Filesystems URL.</b>
The HTTP address for the IDE's Filesystems node, using the
local host's name.
</li>
<li><b>Host IP.</b>
The IP address of the local host.
</li>
<li><b>Internal HTTP Port.</b>
The port used by the IDE's internal HTTP server.
</li>
<li><b>Library Path.</b>
The path for libraries available to the IDE, including any that you
have mounted. 
</li>
<li><b>Working Directory.</b>
The working directory for the debugging process. The default value is null.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The Info tab contains the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>Name.</b>
The name of the RMI Debugging node.
</li>
<li><b>Template.</b>
A template that creates an instance of the RMI debugger using the current property settings.
</li>
</ul>
