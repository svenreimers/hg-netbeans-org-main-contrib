<h2>
RMI Stub Compiler Settings</h2>
This node represents a mode for running the <tt>rmic</tt> compiler and
generating RMI stubs and skeletons. When you generate an RMI implementation
class with the RMI templates or the RMI wizard, this stub compilation mode
is specified. You can see the stub compilation mode that has been specified
for an implementation class by looking at the its property sheet. (The
property sheet's Execution tab has a Stub Compiler property.) When compile
an RMI implementation class, its Stub Compiler property is used to start
the stub compiler.
<p>The settings for this node define the stub compiler that will be executed
when you compile RMI implementation classes.
<h3>
Properties Tab</h3>

<h4>
Error Expression</h4>
A string used in error messages to identify the source of messages issued
when compiling RMI classes.
<h4>
External Compiler</h4>
Identifies the executable used to compile RMI class for stub and skeletons.
Defaults to a local copy of the <tt>rmic</tt> compiler.
<h4>
Identifying Name</h4>
A name for the compilation mode defined with these property settings. Default
value is "RMI Stub Compiler." When this name appears in a class's property
sheet, the IDE uses the compilation mode defined by this node.
