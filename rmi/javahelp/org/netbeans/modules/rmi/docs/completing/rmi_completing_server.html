<h2>Adding Code to a Server-side File</h2>
<p>
The RMI module generates implementation classes that are complete
except for the business logic. In addition, the generated
implementation classes contain code that registers an instance of the
class with an RMI registry running at
<code>//localhost:1099/</code>. If you want to register your server in
another registry you need to modify this code.
</p>
<h4>Adding Business Logic to an Implementation Class</h4>
<p>
Look for the method bodies that were generated for the methods
declared in the remote interface. Add whatever code is needed to
provide the functionality specified in the method signature.
</p>
<p>If your business logic is complex, consider implementing some of it
in private methods that are not declared in the remote interface, or
even in additional classes.
</p>
<h4>Changing the Binding Name</h4>
<p>
The default behavior of a generated implementation class is to create
an instance of itself and bind that instance to a registry under the
class name. For example, if you begin with an interface named
<code>Hello</code>, the RMI module generates an implementation class
named <code>HelloImpl</code>, and the default binding behavior is
determined by the following code: 
<pre>
 HelloImpl obj = new HelloImpl ();
 registerToRegistry("HelloImpl", obj, true);
</pre>
<p>
To change the binding name, change the value of the first
parameter. For example:
<pre>
 HelloImpl obj = new HelloImpl ();
 registerToRegistry("HelloServer", obj, true);
</pre>
</p>

<h4>Changing the RMI Registry</h4>
<p>
The default behavior of a generated implementation class is to look
for an RMI registry on the local machine at port 1099. If it does not
find such a registry, it will create one and then bind the server
instance.
</p>
<p>
The following code relies on this default behavior: </p>
<pre>
 HelloImpl obj = new HelloImpl();
 registerToRegistry("HelloImpl", obj, true);
</pre>
<p>
Since the first parameter, <code>name</code>, does not specify host
and port, these values default to <code>//localhost:1099/</code> in
the <code>rebind</code> call.  If you want to register your server
with some other registry, start the registry (command line) and change
the <code>registerToRegistry</code> arguments.
