<h2> Completing Server-side Files</h2><p>The RMI module generates implementation 
classes that are complete except for the business logic. In addition, the generated 
implementation classes contain code that will register an instance of the class 
with an RMI registry running at <code>//localhost:1099/</code>. If you want to 
register your server in another registry you need to modify this code.</p><h3>Adding 
Business Logic to an Implementation Class</h3>Look for the method bodies that 
were generated for the methods declared in the remote interface. Add whatever 
code is needed to provide the functionality specified in the method signature. 
<p>If your business logic is complex, consider implementing some of it in private 
methods that are not declared in the remote interface, or even in additional classes. 
</p><h3> Changing Code that Specifies the Binding Name</h3>The default behavior 
of a generated implementation class is to create an instance of itself and bind 
that instance to a registry under the class name. For example, if you begin with an 
interface named <code>Hello</code>, the RMI module generates an implementation 
class named <code>HelloImpl</code>, and the default binding behavior is determined 
by the following code: <blockquote><p><code>HelloImpl obj = new HelloImpl ();</code> 
<br><code>registerToRegistry("HelloImpl", obj, true);</code></p></blockquote><p>To 
change the binding name, change the value of the first parameter. For example:</p><blockquote><p><code>HelloImpl 
obj = new HelloImpl ();</code> <br><code>registerToRegistry("HelloServer", obj, 
true);</code></p></blockquote>
<h3> Changing Code that Specifies the RMI Registry</h3>The 
default behavior of a generated implementation class is to look for an RMI registry 
on the local machine at port 1099. If it does not find such a registry, it will 
create one and then bind the server instance.<p>The following code relies 
on this default behavior: </p><blockquote><p><code>HelloImpl obj = new HelloImpl();</code> 
<br><code>registerToRegistry("HelloImpl", obj, true);</code> </p></blockquote><p>Since 
the first parameter, <code>name</code>, does not specify host and port, these 
values default to <code>//localhost:1099/</code> in the <code>rebind</code> call. 
If you want to register your server with some other registry, do the following:</p><ol> 
<li> Start the registry (command line)<p></p></li><li> Change the <code>registerToRegistry</code> 
arguments.</li></ol><h3>Compiling Your Server</h3>The last step in completing 
server files is to compile all the classes related to the server, including the 
remote interface, together. Right-click the node for the RMI server class and 
select <code>Compile </code>from the contextual menu. Doing so also compiles the 
remote interface and generates the stub and skeleton files.<hr><font size=-2><a href="../credits.html">Legal
