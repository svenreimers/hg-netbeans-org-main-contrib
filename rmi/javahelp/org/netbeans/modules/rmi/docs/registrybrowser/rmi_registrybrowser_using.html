<h2>RMI Registry Browser Commands</h2>
<p>
You use the RMI Registry Browser by right-clicking the RMI Registry
node or its subnodes in the Explorer window
and choosing a command from the contextual menu.
The contextual menu for each type of node are described below.
</p>

<h3>RMI Registry Commands</h3>
<p>
This node represents the RMI Registry browser.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Refresh.</b> 
Refreshes all nodes that descend from the RMI Registry node.
</li>

<li>
<b>Reset Loader.</b>
Resets the RMI loader.  Use this command to refresh
the contents of the browser after you change a remote interface.
</li>

<li>
<b>Local Registry</b>
Starts a local registry at the default port of 1099. Type the name of
the host and its port number if you are using a registry other than
default host shown in the Local Registry dialog box.
Once a registry is started, you can use this command to stop the
registry.
</li>

<li>
<b>Add Registry</b>
Adds a remote registry  to the node
hierarchy. You can add a running registry or create a new registry.
</li>

<li>
<b>Properties.</b>
Displays the properties of the selected Registry browser.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Commands for a Specific Registry</h3>
<p>
The nodes displayed when the RMI Registry node is expanded represent a
specific instance of an RMI registry, for example, <tt>localhost:1099</tt>.

<ul>
<li>
<b>Refresh.</b>
Refreshes the nodes that descend from the selected node.
</li>

<li>
<b>Delete.</b>
Deletes the selected node from the Registry browser.
</li>

<li>
<b>Properties.</b>
Displays the properties of the selected registry.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Commands for Remote Objects</h3>
<p>
One of the nodes displayed when a specific registry node is expanded
represents Java objects that have been exported to an RMI registry.  A
registry can contain many remote objects. For example, if you generate
an implementation class with the RMI module and run it, the instance
created by the implementation class's <code>main</code> method appears
as a remote object node.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Delete.</b>
Deletes the selected object from its RMI registry. You can only delete
objects from local registries that you control. For security reasons,
you cannot delete objects from a remote RMI registry.
</li>

<li>
<b>Properties.</b>
Displays the properties of the selected remote object.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Remote Interface Menu</h3>
<p>
The nodes displayed when a remote object node is expanded
represent the remote interfaces that are implemented by the remote
object.

<ul>
<li>
<b>Copy Client Code.</b>
Copies lookup code for the selected remote interface to the Forte for
Java clipboard. This code returns a reference to the selected remote
interface.  You can paste this code into your client source code and
use the reference to invoke methods declared by the remote
interface. In general, this code looks like the following example:
<pre>
  try {
      interface obj = (interface) Naming.lookup ("//host:port/name")
  }
    catch (Exception ex) {
    ex.printStackTrace();
  }
</pre>

<li>
<b>Save Interface.</b> 
Makes a local copy of the selected interface. A dialog box opens in
which you specify the package to contain the copy. This can be
useful when you need a copy of the interface for compilation.
</li>

<li>
<b>Properties.</b>
Displays the properties of the selected remote interface.
</li>
</ul>
