<h2>
Using the RMI Registry Browser</h2>
You use the RMI Registry Browser by right-clicking on the RMI Registry
node or its subnodes. The context menu for each type of node displays the
appropriate commands.
<h3>
RMI Registry Node Commands</h3>
This node represents the RMI Module's Registry Browser.
<h4>
Refresh</h4>
Refresh all of the nodes that descend from the RMI Registry node.
<h4>
New Registry</h4>
Add a new registry to the node hierarchy. You can add a running registry
or create a new registry.
<h4>
Properties</h4>
Display the Registry Browser's properties.
<h3>
Registry Node Commands</h3>
Each of these nodes represents an RMI registry (for example, //localhost:1099/)
that is viewed in the Registry Browser.
<h4>
Refresh</h4>
Refreshes all the nodes that descend from the selected node.
<h4>
Delete</h4>
Deletes the selected node from the registry browser. This command terminates
only those registry processes that were started with the Registry Browser.
<h4>
Properties</h4>
Displays the properties of the selected registry.
<h3>
Remote Object Node Commands</h3>
These nodes represent Java objects that have been exported to an RMI registry.
A registry can contain many remote objects. For example, if you generate
an implementation class with the RMI module and run it, the instance created
by the implementation class's&nbsp; main method will appear as a remote
object node.
<h4>
Customize Bean</h4>
Displays the customizable properties, if any, of the selected remote object.
<h4>
Delete</h4>
Delete the selected object from its RMI Registry. You can only delete objects
from local registries that you control;&nbsp; for obvious security reasons,
you cannot delete objects from a remote RMI registry.
<h4>
Properties</h4>
Display the properties of the selected Remote Object.
<h3>
Remote Interface Node Commands</h3>
These nodes represent the remote interfaces that are implemented by a remote
object.
<h4>
Copy Client Code</h4>
Copies lookup code for the selected remote interface to the Forte for Java
clipboard. This code returns a reference to the selected remote interface.
You can paste this code into your client source code and use the reference
to invoke methods declared by the remote interface. In general, this code
looks like the following example:
<blockquote>&nbsp;<tt>try {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interface obj = (interface) Naming.lookup ("//host:port/name")</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;} catch (Exception ex) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ex.printStackTrace();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;}</tt></blockquote>

<h4>
Save Interface</h4>
Makes a local copy of the selected interface. (Opens a dialog on which
you specify the package in which to put the copy.) This can be useful when
you need a copy of the interface for compilation.
