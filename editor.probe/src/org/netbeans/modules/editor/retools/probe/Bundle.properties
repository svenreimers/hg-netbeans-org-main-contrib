CTL_AllEditorStatus=Dump Status of All Editors...
OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category=Editing
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    This module was created for hunting down defects like http://www.netbeans.org/nonav/issues/show_bug.cgi?\
    id=119617. \
    It finds all opened editors and when requested dumps their status. \
    It listens on an HTTP port 9000 (or higher) for requests and sends back the editor status in form of plain text.\n\n\
    <p>Here is how to use it:\n\n<ol>\n<li>Install the module and check for 'Editor Probe listening on port XYZ' message in the log\n<li>Go to your browser and load http://localhost:XYZ/\n<li>You should see a message asking you to switch back to Netbeans and wait, please do so.\n\
    <li>After a while (5 sec) the page will be refreshed with the editor status\n<li>You can copy-paste or 'Save Page As' the status info and attach it to an issue that you are helping to hunt down and somebody will analyze it.\n\
    </ol>\n\n<p>Thanks!
