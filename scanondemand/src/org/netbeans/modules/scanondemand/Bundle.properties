OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    With this module you can get more control over the scanning your IDE performs to keep internal information about your sources up to date.\n\n\
    This module disables automatic scanning on start and after activation of main window (however the IDE continues to listens on changes in sources via native \
    file system listeners). \
    In case your IDE indices get out of data, you need to refresh them manually by invoking "refresh" action from various menus.\n\n\
    Alternatively you can also create a configuration file and prevent changes in these files to trigger rescan.
