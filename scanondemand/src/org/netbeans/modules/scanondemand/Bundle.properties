OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    With this module you can get more control over the scanning your IDE performs to keep internal information about your sources up to date.\n\n\
    This module disables automatic scanning on start and after the main window gets focus. \
    Instead you need to do it manually by invokig "refresh" action from various menus.\n\n\
    Alternatively you can also create a configuration file and prevent changes in these files to trigger rescan.
