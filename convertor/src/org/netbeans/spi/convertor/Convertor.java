/**
 * Base interface for object conversion to XML namespace aware fragment
 * and conversion of this fragment back to the object.
 *
 * <p>Inseparatable part of the convertor is its declarative registration which
 * must be done in JAR Manifest. The example of such registration is:
 *
 * <p><code>
 *  &nbsp;Name: com/yourdomain/YourConvertor.class<br>
 *  &nbsp;NetBeans-Convertor: {yournamespace}yourelement, yourclass
 * </code>
 *
 * <p>where
 *
 * <p><lu>
 *   <li><code>Name:</code> is fully qualified name of the class of your convertor,
 *         that is class implementing Convertor interface</li>
 *   <li><code>NetBeans-Convertor:</code> declaration of your convertor</li>
 *   <li><code>yournamespace</code> is XML namespace which
 *       your convertor is capable to read</li>
 *   <li><code>yourelement</code> is element name from 
 *       the XML namespace which your convertor is capable to read</li>
 *   <li><code>yourclass</code> is fully qualified name of the 
 *       class which instances (but not subclasses!) is your convertor capable to 
 *       persist. This is the only attribute which is optional and if omitted it means 
 *       that your convertor is not capable to persist any class.</li>
 *</lu>
 *
 * <p>The Convertor infrastructure will use the information from manifest to 
 * create instance of your convertor and will call your convertor only with parameters
 * matching the declared criteria.
 *
 * <p>It is guaranteed that {@link #read} method will be
 * called only with element from the declared namespace and with the
 * declared name. The object created by read method does not have to be
 * assignable to class in NetBeans-Convertor attribute. It can be
 * object of any type.
 *
 * <p>It is guaranteed that {@link #write} method will be called only
 * if the object's class is equal to class declared in NetBeans-Convertor
 * attribute and only if the convertor's classloader is equal to, 
 * or a descendant of, the classloader used to load the object's class.
 * If NetBeans-Convertor attribute does not specify class name the write method will
 * never be called. The element created by write method is not constrained by
 * the value of NetBeans-Convertor attribute. It can be element with arbitrary
 * name and namespace.
 *
 * <p>The JAR Manifest can contain multiple convertors. One convertor can be
 * registered for multiple namespaces/elements. In such a case the name of 
 * the <code>NetBeans-Convertor</code> attribute must be suffixed by "-" and 
 * number, eg.:
 *
 * <p><code> 
 *  &nbsp;Name: com/yourdomain/YourConvertor.class<br>
 *  &nbsp;NetBeans-Convertor: {yourdomain.com/firstns}firstelement, com.yourdomain.FirstClass<br>
 *  &nbsp;NetBeans-Convertor-2: {yourdomain.com/secondns}secondreadonlyelement<br>
 *  &nbsp;NetBeans-Convertor-3: {yourdomain.com/thirdns}thirdelement, com.yourdomain.ThirdClass
 * </code>
 *
 * <p><strong>Recommendations for convertor implementors:</strong><br>
 * <lu>
 *   <li>It is strongly recommended to keep all details of the Java memory 
 *         representation (implementation class names, field names, etc.)
 *         out of the storage format. Otherwise you run into the problems 
 *         whenever you refactor the implementation class internally.</li>
 * </lu>
 *
 * <p>See also {@link SimplyConvertible} for information about how to persist
 * your object without writing your own Convertor.
