<span style="font-style: italic;">The Convertor API was inspired by
core/settings module created by Jan Pokorsky and&nbsp; Jaroslav
Tulach. Credit must go to people from nbdev mailing list (especially to
Jesse Glick) for providing valuable feedback which was incorporated.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
The convertor module allows to convert object to XML namespace aware
fragment and to convert this fragment back to instance of an
object.
The
module consists of SPI and API part. The SPI part defines convertor
interface to be implemented by clients and alternative for persistence
of object without the need to write your own convertor. The API part
has small set of
helper static methods operating on all available convertors which
clients can
use to convert XML fragments to objects and vice versa.<br>

of available convertors can be found at the following links:<br>
