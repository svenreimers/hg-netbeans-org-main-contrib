Implements suggestion framework (<code>tasklist.client</code>, <code>tasklist.providers</code>) API.

<h2>Suggestion Framework Implementation</h2>

<h3>Model</h3>

The default implementation provides 3 basic processors:

<dl>
<dt>{@link SuggestionsScanner}
<dd>It can scan suggestions into snapshot list
in specified context. It queries registered
<code>DocumentSuggestionProvider</code> providers.

<dt>{@link SuggestionsBroker}
<dd>It maintains live suggestions list for currently edited
source or for all opened sources. It queries registered
<code>DocumentSuggestionProvider</code> providers.

<dt>{@link SuggestionManagerImpl}
<dd>It maintains live suggestions list containing
suggestions registered by active <code>SuggestionProvider</code>s.

</dl>

<p>
Suggestion providers registry is modeled using
{@link SuggestionTypes}, {@link SuggestionProviders}
and {@link SuggestionTypeProcessor}. SuggestionManagerImpl
also contais some dispatch type of methods accessing the
registry.

<h3>GUI</h3>

There are also some support classes for actions, annotations, node and
default suggestions view. Note that no arbitrart view can be created
using pure <code>tasklist.client</code> APIs
