/**
  Implements a document suggestion cache.
  This makes switching back and forth between files
  "immediate" once the suggestions have been computed
  in the first place. The suggestions are immediately
  posted (not just meaning that it's not recomputed
  so you get the slow refresh one by one, but there's
  no delay either).
<p>
The cache works as follows:
<ul>
   <li> When an entry is added to the cache, it adds a listener
     to the document. If the document changes when the
     document is not showing, the cache entry is invalidated/
     removed.
   <li> SuggestionImpl's keep a provider reference. When
     you swap files, all the suggestions currently showing
     are dumped to the cache. 
   <li> when you open a file, in docShown we first
     consult the cache. If found, simply use those, 
     otherwise call docShown as before.
   <li> TODO: the cache listens for document closes, and wipes
     out cache entries
   <li> PENDING: the cache is a weak listener so does not
     prevent garbage collection.
   <li> PENDING: Consider whether or not the cache should have
     a max size.
</ul>
<p>
Here's how the SuggestionManager uses the cache:
<ul>
  <li> When suggestions are modified for a document,
        the cache is cleared for that document.
  <li> When the suggestions window is hidden, the cache
        is flushed
  <li> When a file is switched:
    <ul>
     <li> the current contents are added to the cache. Some
        optimization should be added here such that if you don't edit the
        file that's open, no work is done. The items are then
        removed from the list.
     <li> the cache is consulted for the list in the existing
        file, and only if empty (or is scanOnShow is true) does a 
        new scan take place.
    </ul>
   <li> When documents are closed, the cache should be notified.
        This is done because the cache cannot easily listen for
        document close events, and the suggestion manager already
        has a way of detecting these.
</ul>
<p>
  @todo What about suggestions derived from Documents which have
     external dependencies? For example, after changing document
     "foo", document Bar may get new scan errors in it - but
     we wouldn't notice. Perhaps DocumentSuggestionProviders can
     provide a hint about whether or not they expect their
     contents to be 100% derivable from a single document.
