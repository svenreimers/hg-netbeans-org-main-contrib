API classes and interfaces that serve as an entry point to a metadata repository.
The fundamental classes in this regard are <a href="MDRManager.html">MDRManager</a>
and <a href="MDRepository.html">MDRepository</a>.
<p>MDRManager is used to access repositories (represented
by instances of MDRepository, these can then be used
to access instances of MOF metamodels (represented by javax.jmi.reflect.RefPackage instances
corresponding to package proxies for outermost packages of the metamodels). MDRManager is
a singleton. There can be several repositories in the system (accessible via MDRManager) and
each repository may contain any number of instances of any number of metamodels.

<h3>Creating Metamodel Instances</h3>
Here is an example code showing how to create a new empty instance of MOF metamodel
that can be used e.g. to load XMI files conforming to MOF:
<p>
<pre>
    // get default repository
    MDRepository repository = MDRManager.getDefault().getDefaultRepository();
    // create a new instance of MOF metamodel - name it MyInstanceOfMOF
    RefPackage mof = null;
    try {
        mof = repository.createExtent("MyInstanceOfMOF");
    } catch (CreationFailedException e) {
        // handle the failure - happens if extent (i.e. metamodel instance) named
        // MyInstanceOfMOF already exists in the repository, or if some other fatal
        // error occurs
        ...
    }
    ...
</pre>

<h3>Accessing Metamodel Instances</h3>
Instances of metamodels in the repository are also called extents. Following is
an example code that retrieves a reference to an extent created in the first example
from the repository:
<p>
<pre>
    // get default repository
    MDRepository repository = MDRManager.getDefault().getDefaultRepository();
    // get an extent named MyInstanceOfMOF
    RefPackage mof = repository.getExtent("MyInstanceOfMOF");
    if (mof == null) {
        // the previous call returned null - it means that an extent with a given
        // name was not found
        System.out.println("Extent named MyInstanceOfMOF not found in the repository.");
        ...
    }
    ...
</pre>

<h3>Working with Transactions</h3>
MDRepository interfaces supports transactional processing. Simple atomic per-repository
transactions are assumed. Capability of real nested transactions is optional (see description
of beginTrans and endTrans method of <a href="MDRepository.html">MDRepository</a> class for
more information.
<p>When working with transactions it is important to strictly enforce the following pattern:
<ol>
    <li>Start a transaction
    <li>Start a try block
    <li>Do the work
    <li>Finalize the transaction in the finally clause of the try block
</ol>
When not using explicit transactions, it is assumed that all JMI calls
are auto-commited.
<p>It is essential to use transactions in multithreaded applications especially
when iterating through the content of collections returned from JMI calls (since
these collections are live) to avoid concurrent modifications. Here is an example code
that iterates through all class proxies in a given extent and uses a read-only transaction
to ensure that the collection is not modified by other thread during the iteration:
<p>
<pre>
    // get the default repository
    MDRepository repository = MDRManager.getDefault().getDefaultRepository();
    // start a read-only transaction
    repository.beginTrans(false);
    try {
        // get an extent named MyInstanceOfMOF (assuming that this extent was already created by
        // other part of the application
        RefPackage mof = repository.getExtent("MyInstanceOfMOF");
        for (Iterator it = mof.refAllClasses(); it.hasNext();) {
            RefClass clsProxy = (RefClass) it.next();
            // print name of the class proxy meta-object
            System.out.println(((MofClass) clsProxy.refMetaObject()).getName());
        }
    } finally {
        // release the transaction
        repository.endTrans();
    }
</pre>

<h3>Other Use-Cases</h3>
Please see <a href="../xmi/package-summary.html">MDR XMI API description</a> for more info 
on how to load/save XMI files into/from repository extents.
<p>Also for a more complete example of an application that uses MDR to load UML metamodel, 
instantiate it in the repository, load an UML model from XMI to the instance of UML metamodel, 
transform it to MOF (into an instance of MOF metamodel) and serialize it to XMI as an instance
of MOF, please refer to the source code of the 
<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/source/browse/~checkout~/mdr/extras/uml2mof/src/org/netbeans/lib/jmi/uml2mof/Main.java?content-type=text/plain">Main class</a>
of <a href="http://mdr.netbeans.org/uml2mof">UML2MOF tool</a>.
