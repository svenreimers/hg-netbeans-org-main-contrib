/** Implementation of this interface can be passed to XMI reader/consumer
 * (using {@link XMIInputConfig#setReferenceResolver} method) to enable custom resolving of hrefs.
 * If an XMIReferenceResolver is registered for an XMI consumer, the XMI consumer will call
 * {@link #register} for each object that it successfuly deserialized from the XMI file.
 * At the end of the document the XMI consumer will call {@link #resolve} passing all the
 * hrefs found in the document and an object that implements {@link XMIReferenceResolver.Client}
 * to receive callbacks.
 * Implementation of XMIReferenceResolver should try to
 * resolve these hrefs and make callbacks to the passed client (by calling
 * {@link XMIReferenceResolver.Client#resolvedReference}) for each resolved href.<p>
 * Note, that in some obscure cases, the XMI consumer may call {@link #register} method
 * even during the execution of {@link XMIReferenceResolver.Client#resolvedReference} method 
 * in case when XMI consumer had to postpone creation of some object because of unresolved 
 * reference to an object within an attribute (i.e. if an unresolved object was part of 
 * an attribute value).
 * <i>IMPORTANT: During the whole XMI reading, the XMI consumer should
 * hold a lock on the used XMIReferenceResolver instance to avoid concurrency problems.</i>
