* Upgrade to DocBook 5
Still in beta.
How to make code completion work w/o DTD?
(Maybe use new Schema-based CC in NB 5.5/6; Schema for DB is unofficial but probably sufficient for CC.)
** Automatic background validation using RELAXNG (JAXP) and Schematron (Skeleton)
How to run Skeleton?

* Auto preview
Swing HTML browser after XSLT, probably.
Where to display?
What kind of refresh - while typing? after save?

* Syntax highlighting
** Could use XSLTHL
Requires Saxon.
Does not handle <callout> etc.
Java language support does not look great (no assert, no type highlighting, ...).
