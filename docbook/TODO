Still in beta.
How to make code completion work w/o DTD?

* Auto preview
Swing HTML browser after XSLT, probably.
Where to display?
What kind of refresh - while typing? after save?

* Syntax highlighting
** Could use XSLTHL
Requires Saxon.
Does not handle <callout> etc.
Java language support does not look great (no assert, no type highlighting, ...).
