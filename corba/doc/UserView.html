<h2><a name="6">6. CORBA Naming System Browser</a></h2>

   CORBA
 Naming System Browser allows user to add new naming context, browse them,
 and  generate code usable in developing server or client that use Naming
 Service as bind method.  

<h3><a name="6.1">6.1 Code Generation</a></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;
 &nbsp; User is able to generate lookup code to Clipboard from each Object in&nbsp;
 the &nbsp; directory context hierarchy or binding code from Context objects by&nbsp;
 selecting &nbsp; the desired node and choosing the copy action from pop up menu.&nbsp;
 If the node represents NamingContext, than the user is able to copy binding&nbsp;
 code, else if the node represents bound object the access code for this&nbsp;
 object. After pasting the code to the instance of server or client template&nbsp;
 user obtains fully functional code for manipulating with objects in Naming&nbsp;
 Service.<br>
 
<h4><a name="6.2">6.2 Object Properties</a></h4> &nbsp; &nbsp; Browser also
 offers to user possibility to display detailed information&nbsp; about object
 by selecting the corresponding node and choosing Properties&nbsp; action form
 pop up menu. In these properties user can see the IOR (Inter operable&nbsp; Object
 Reference) of the object, id (name displayed in browser) of object&nbsp; and
 kind of object.<br>
<h4><a name="6.3">6.3 Manipulation Function</a></h4>


 &nbsp;&nbsp; CORBA Naming System Browser has also functions for creating new Naming
 Contexts, binding new Objects or Contexts and unbinding them. These functions
 can be accessed from&nbsp; pop up menu. <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; When action for creating new context is activated the dialog appears. In this dialog user fills id and kind of new context.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; By activating bind new Object or Context action similar dialog appears.
 In this dialog user fills id, kind and IOR or URL of resource containing
 the IOR.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="7"> 7. CORBA Interface Repository Browser</a></h2>
CORBA Interface Repository Browser allows user to add new interface repositories,&nbsp;
 browse them, explore metadata contained in them and generate IDL (Interface&nbsp;
 Definition Laguage) from them. The interface repository browser is also&nbsp;
 used by CORBA Wizard to allow user import IDL definition directly from IR.<br>
<h2></h2>
<h4><a name="7.1">7.1 Code Generation</a></h4>
<h4> </h4>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; User is able to generate IDL source code for Interface Repository mounted
 in&nbsp; the browser or for its reasonable part. The code generation action is
 not allowed on nodes that can not be generated separately and must be generated
 only as a member of some container, e.g. attribute or operation. The code
 is generated into Clipboard and than can be pasted to target idl file. The
 Copy Code action can be started by selected desired node and choosing the
 action from pop up menu.<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="7.2">7.2 Object Properties</a></h4> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Browser also
 offers to user posibility to explore properties of objects&nbsp; in Interface
 Repository. The properties contains for example RepositoryId&nbsp; of IDL type,
 name, version and proprietary information that depends on kind&nbsp; of selected
 object, for example&nbsp; for interface these information are: base&nbsp; interfaces.<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="8"> 8. CORBA Wizard</a></h2> &nbsp; &nbsp; CORBA Wizard helps
 user to develop complete CORBA application. It leads&nbsp; user through all stages
 of development of CORBA application, namely creating&nbsp; or importing IDL,
 generating implementation files, creating of server and&nbsp; or client. <br>
<br>
<h4><a name="8.1">8.1 Choosing Destination Package</a></h4>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The first panel that appears in the CORBA Wizard lets user to select
 destination package in mounted file systems and specify the name of IDL
 file. From the name of IDL file will be also derived the names of client
 and server. If the specified IDL file already exists in the destination
 package the next button is disabled.<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="8.2">8.2 Choosing Type of CORBA Application</a></h4>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; In the second panel user chooses which part of CORBA application would
 like to create. If he wants to import IDL file or create it. If he wants
 to generate implementation files, create client and or server.<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="8.3">8.3 Choosing ORB Implementation</a></h4>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The third panel lets user to specify which ORB Implementation and binding
 method he would like to use. It also lets him specify if he wants to generate
 inheriance based or tie based implementation files.<br>

<h4><a name="8.4">8.4 Specifying IDL</a></h4>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth panel is for creating ir importing IDL, its version depends on the value of Create IDL item in the second panel.<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="8.4.1">8.4.1 Creating IDL</a></h4>
 &nbsp; This panel allows user to create IDL file using writable tree. The new
 IDL entries are added by selecting parent container in tree and pressing
 button that represents the desired data type in dynamic button panel. After
 the buton is clicked the dialog appers, in this dialog user fills information
 about IDL entity.<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="8.4.2">8.4.2 Importing IDL</a></h4>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; This panel is design to import IDL either from file or from Interface Repository.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="8.5">8.5 Importing IDL</a></h4>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The last panel informs user about finishing of CORBA Wizard steps,
 by pressing the Finish button wizard generates requested source code.<br>
