<p><br>The User can use CORBA Support module&nbsp; for development, testing&nbsp;
and debuging any kind of CORBA Application in NetBeans IDE. IDE will provide
support for writting idl file in editor or generating it from various templates.
This will be supported even for client and server main and implementation
classes.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="IDL and Editor"></a><b><font size=+2>IDL editing and parsing</font></b>
<p>Editor for IDL will have syntax coloring and hooks functionality. After
writting IDL code in the IDE's Editor - developer can browse this code
(file) in Explorer throw the IDL Tree. This tree will be only read-only
- so developer can't change and properties of any node in this tree. The
IDE provides for developer full functional IDL Parser so if developer makes
some bugs (parse error) in written IDL code - IDE can't parse this IDL
file and nothing is displayed in IDL Tree except incorrect IDL code icon
for this file.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="IDL compilation"></a><b><font size=+2>IDL compilation</font></b>
<p>After IDL code writting - IDE will help developer with compiling this
code with vendor supplied IDL compiler. IDE can hide generated classes
or not - it depends on setuped options for this orb.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Imlementation Generator"></a><b><font size=+2>Implementation
Generator</font></b>
<p>After writting IDL file - developer have to implement all interfaces
which writes to this IDL file. Our IDE helps him with this task and throw
Implementation generator will generate basic (whithout methods body) implementation
for all interfaces from this IDL file. For this generation developer can
setup some properties - e.g. what generate to methods bodies etc.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Server and Client main classes"></a><b><font size=+2>Server
and Client main classes</font></b>
<p>Developer can use IDE for very quick creating of server and client main
class. This creation depends havilly on setuped properties - on setupped
binding methods, orb version etc.
<br>This code is generated throw the IDE templates and this code contains
comments and hooks - where developer has to add your appropriate code such
as servant variable etc.

<a NAME="CORBA Wizard"></a><b><font size=+2>CORBA Wizard</font></b></dt>

<dt>
CORBA is very complex technology and using it isn't easy for begginer programmer.
The IDE helps this programmer with very usefull wizard which helps them
with first CORBA application development steps and will be very intuitive.</dt>
</dl>

<p><br><a NAME="Browsers"></a><b><font size=+2>CORBA Services Browsers</font></b>
<p>CORBA platform provides to development and runtime many very usefull
services. It will be reat if IDE support connecting to this services and
browsing throw these servicies. very usefull will be browsers for Naming
Service - which can developer use for development of server and client
where he use binding method which use naming service. The second CORBA
service which is very usefull to browse is Interface Repository. This browser
will be usefull for developing client application for existing CORBA application
even remotely. IDE will connect to the remote Interface Repository and
develper can copy IDL code from it, compile it with IDL compiler and create
client of even running CORBA server/service.
