<HTML><BODY>

This template creates a class suitable for a CORBA call-back client. The name you specify is
used as both the class and file name. For example, if you specify
<tt>HelloClient</tt>, a file named <tt>HelloClient.java</tt> is
created that defines the class <tt>HelloClient</tt>. Comments in the
generated code help you finish the class definition.
<p>
The template mechanism generates code appropriate for the ORB product
specified in the ORB Version property of the CORBA Settings. In
addition, the generated code uses the binding method (Naming Service,
IOR in file, IOR in client code or ORB vendor's proprietary binding)
specified in the Client Binding property of the CORBA Settings. The
CORBA Settings node can be found in the Project Settings window.</p>
