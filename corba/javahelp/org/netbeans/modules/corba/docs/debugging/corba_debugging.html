<h2>Debugging CORBA Programs</h2>

<p>
You can use the IDE's debugger with your CORBA client and server programs.
There are a few things you must consider:
<ul>
<li>
You must debug client and server programs separately; you cannot start
the debugger on the client side and trace the remote method call into the
server. ( What you should do is start the debugger on the server side and
then run the client; the debugger will show the server executing in response
to the request.)</li>

<li>
You cannot use the IDE's debugger for processes that are started
outside of the IDE. In particular, you cannot debug CORBA server
processes that are started from an implementation repository.</li>

<li>
If you want to debug a server-side program that is already running, you
need to unbind it from the naming service before restarting it. (If you
don't, you will get an exception when the binding code executes.)

<ul>
<li>
If you have the naming service attached in the Naming Service Browser (on
the Runtime tab of Explorer), right click on the node for the server, choose
Unbind from the context menu.</li>

<li>
If it is not attached, you will need too kill and restart <tt>tnameserv</tt>
by either using shell utilities (<tt>ps</tt> and <tt>kill</tt>) or using
your operating system's task manager to kill the <tt>tnameserv</tt> process.
Restart it using the same arguments as before (<tt>tnameserv -ORBInitialPort
1050</tt>).</li></ul></li>

<li>
If you only want to debug the client side, it is not necessary to restart
the naming service and rebind the implementation instance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Setting Breakpoints</h3>

<p>
Use the standard IDE procedures for setting breakpoints. For example, to
set a breakpoint in the Hello World example's implementation class:
<ol>
<li>
Go to the <tt>HelloImpl</tt> class in the editor and locate the line containing the
<tt>for()</tt> loop in the code that you entered earlier.</li>

<li>
Put the insertion point on this line, and press CTRL-F8 to set a breakpoint
on this line.</li>

<li>
Select the <tt>HelloServer</tt> class in the Explorer, and press F5 to start the
server in the debugger.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Execute the client as you did before. Server-side execution will pause
at your breakpoint. Just as when debugging other Java objects, you can
freely make use of tracing, watch variables, and other debugging techniques.
