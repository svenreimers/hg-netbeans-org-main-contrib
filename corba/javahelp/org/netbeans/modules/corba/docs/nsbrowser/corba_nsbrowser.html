<h2>The Naming Service Browser</h2>

<p>
The CORBA Naming Service browser enables you to browse naming services that
are running on your local machine or elsewhere on the network. You can
see the naming contexts, subcontexts, and CORBA services that have been
registered with the naming service, and perform naming service operations
such as creating new contexts, binding contexts and unbinding contexts.
</p>
<p>
The naming contexts and CORBA servers are represented by subnodes of
the browser node. You can select a node and have the browser generate
code that binds an object to the selected node or code that performs a
<tt>resolve()</tt> and returns a reference to the selected node.
</p>
<p> 
You can also use the Naming Service browser to generate the code
you need to complete client and server classes generated with the
IDE's CORBA templates.</p>
