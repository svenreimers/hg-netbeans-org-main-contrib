<h2>Naming Service Browser Commands</h2>
<p>
Use the Naming Service browser by right-clicking the CORBA Naming
Service node or its subnodes in the Runtime tab of the Explorer. The
contextual menu for each type of node displays the appropriate
commands.</p>

<h3>CORBA Naming Service Node Commands</h3>
This node represents the naming service.

<h4>Bind New Context</h4>
<p>Connects to a running naming service and displays the contents of the naming
service.</p>

<h4>Start Local</h4>
<p>Starts a local naming service.</p>

<h3>Naming Context Node Commands</h3>
<p>These nodes represent naming contexts, including the initial context, found
in naming services.</p>

<h4>Create New Context</h4>
<p>Creates a new context underneath the selected context. The browser
represents the new context as a subnode of the selected node.</p>

<h4>Bind New Context</h4>
<p>Binds a running naming service into the selected context. You must supply
the naming service's interoperable object reference (IOR), either as a
URL to a file that holds the IOR, or as text that you paste (into the IOR
field in the dialog box opened by this command).</p>

<h4>Unbind Context</h4>
<p>Removes the selected context and its subnodes from the browser's context
tree. If you select a top-level node that represents a naming
service server, you only unbind the naming service from the 
Naming Service browser. But if you select any other node and execute this
command, you actually remove the context or object from the naming
service.</p>

<h4>Copy Server Binding Code</h4> 
<p>Generates code for binding a server object to the selected context
and copies the code to the system clipboard. You can paste this code
into a server-side program and complete it, thereby binding an
instance of an implementation class into the naming context you
originally selected.</p>

<h4>Bind New Object</h4> 
<p>Binds a running server object into the selected context. You must
supply the server object's IOR, either as a URL to a file that holds
the IOR or as text that you paste into the IOR field in the dialog box
opened by this command.</p>

<h4>Refresh</h4>
<p>Refreshes the selected node and all of its subnodes.</p>

<h4>Properties</h4>
<p>Displays the properties of the selected node.</p>

<h3>Server Object Node Commands</h3>
<p>These nodes represent CORBA servant objects that have been registered with
a naming service. A naming service can contain many servant object nodes.</p>

<h4>Unbind Object</h4>
<p>Unbinds the selected object.</p>

<h4>Copy Client Code</h4>
<p>Generates code for binding a client to the selected server object and copies
it to the system clipboard. You can paste this code into a client-side
program, and it will return a reference to the server you
selected.</p>

<h4>Properties</h4>
<p>Displays the properties of the selected server object node.</p>
