<h2>
Using the Naming Service Browser</h2>
You use the Naming Service Browser by right-clicking on the CORBA Naming
Service node or its subnodes. The context menu for each type of node displays
the appropriate commands.
<h3>
CORBA Naming Service Node Commands</h3>

<h4>
Bind New Context</h4>
Connects to a running naming service and displays the contents of the naming
service.
<h3>
Naming Context Node Commands</h3>
These nodes represent naming contexts, including the initial context, found
in naming services.
<h4>
Create New Context</h4>
Creates a new context underneath the selected context; the browser represents
the new context as a sub-node of the selected node.
<h4>
Bind New Context</h4>
Binds a running naming service into the selected context. You must supply
the naming service's interoperable object reference (IOR), either as a
URL to a file that holds the IOR, or as text that you paste (into the IOR
field in the dialog opened by this command).
<h4>
Unbind Context</h4>
Removes the selected context and its sub-nodes from the browser's context
tree. Note that if you select a top-level node that represents a naming
service server, you only unbind the naming service from the Forte for Java
Naming Service Browser. But if you select any other node and execute this
command, you will actually remove the context or object from the naming
service.
<h4>
Copy Server Binding Code</h4>
Generates code for binding a server object to the selected context and
copies it to the system clipboard. You can paste this code into a server-side
program and complete it, and it will bind an instance of an implementation
class into the naming context you originally selected.
<h4>
Bind New Object</h4>
Binds a running server object into the selected context. You must supply
the server object's IOR, either as a URL to a file that holds the IOR,
or as text that you paste (into the IOR field in the dialog opened by this
command).
<h4>
Refresh</h4>
Refresh the selected node and all of its subnodes.
<h4>
Properties</h4>
Display the properties of the selected node.
<h3>
Server Object Node Commands</h3>
These nodes represent CORBA servant objects that have been registered with
a naming service. A naming service can contain many servant object nodes.
<h4>
Unbind Object</h4>
Unbind the selected object.
<h4>
Copy Client Code</h4>
Generates code for binding a client to the selected server object and copies
it to the system clipboard. You can paste this code into a client-side
program, and it will return a reference to the server you selected.
<h4>
Properties</h4>
Displays the properties of the selected server object node.
