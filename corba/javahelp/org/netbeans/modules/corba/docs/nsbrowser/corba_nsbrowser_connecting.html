<h2>Starting the Naming Service Browser</h2>

<p>
To start the Naming Service browser and view a naming service, you need
the naming service's IOR.
</p>

<h3>Obtaining the Naming Service IOR</h3>
<p>
If the naming service is being managed by a system administrator, the
naming service IOR is probably stored in a well-known
file. Specify this file when you start the Naming Service browser.</p>
<p>
If you are managing the naming service yourself, you need to obtain
an IOR when you start the naming service from the command line.
The following example shows how to start the JDK 1.2 ORB's naming
service.</p>
 
<p>
<b>To start a naming service:</b>
<ol>
<li>
Open a command shell and navigate to the ORB's installation
directory. Navigate to the <tt>/bin</tt> directory.
<p>
This example shows how to start a JDK ORB naming service.</li>
<li>
Start the naming service by typing:
<pre>
 tnameserv -ORBInitialPort 1050
</pre>
<p>
If the naming service returns an error message indicating that the
port is in use, you can use a different port number. Make a note of
the number, as you will need to know it for the next procedure.</p></li>
<li>
The naming service returns information on the command line that is similar
to the following output:
<pre>
 Initial Naming Context:
 IOR:000000000000002849444c3a6f6d672e6f72672f436f734e616d696e672f4
 e616d696e67436f6e746578743a312e30000000000100000000000000300
 00100000000000774696d2d7773000006db000000000018afabcafe00000
 002cbb35b05000000080000000000000000
 TransientNameServer: setting port for initial object references to: 1050
</pre>
</ol>
<p>
A simple way to get this IOR into the Naming Service browser is to copy
it to the clipboard. You want the string beginning with
<tt>IOR</tt> and ending at the last non-blank character before
<tt>TransientNameServer</tt>. After copying the IOR to the clipboard,
you can either:
<ul>
<li>
Start the Naming Service browser and paste the IOR from the clipboard to
the Naming Service browser's startup dialog box.</li>
<li>
Paste the IOR from the command shell into a text editor, and save it to
a text file. You can then start the Naming Service browser and specify
this text file in the Naming Service browser's startup dialog box.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Starting the Naming Service Browser</h3>

<p>
To use the Naming Service browser with the naming service
process that you started earlier:
<ol>
<li>
Switch to the Runtime tab of the Explorer.</li>
<li>
Right-click the CORBA Naming Service node and choose Bind New
Context. A dialog box appears that enables you to tell the Naming
Service browser how to find the service.</li> 
<li>
Type entries for the Name and Kind fields. For example, if a JDK
naming service is used, you would type JDK in the Name field
and Naming in the Kind field.</li>
<li>
Supply the naming service IOR in one of the following ways:</li>
<ul>
<li>
If you copied the IOR to a file, type the URL for the file (using <tt>file:///</tt><em>pathname</em>) into the URL field.</li>
<li>
Paste the IOR that you cut from the command line into the IOR field.</li>
</ul>
<li>
Click OK to close the dialog box. A new node, named JDK, appears under
CORBA Naming Service. The Naming Service browser is now communicating with
the naming service process you have specified.</li>
</ol>
