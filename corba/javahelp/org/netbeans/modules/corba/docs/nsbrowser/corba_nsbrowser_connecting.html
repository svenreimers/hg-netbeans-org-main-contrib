<h2>
Starting the Naming Service Browser</h2>
The Naming Service Browser enables you to view the contents of a running
naming service. The naming contexts and CORBA servers are represented by
subnodes of the browser node. You can select a node and have the browser
generate code that will bind an object to the selected node or code that
will perform a resolve() and return a reference to the selected node.
<p>To start the Naming Service Browser and view a naming service, you need
the naming service's IOR.
<h3>
Obtaining the Naming Service IOR</h3>
If the naming service is being managed by a system administrator, the naming
service IOR will probably be stored in a well-known file. Specify this
file when you start the Naming Service Browser.
<p>If you are managing the naming service yourself, you need to obtain
an IOR when you start the naming service from the command line. For example,
to start the JDK 1.2 ORB Naming Service:
<ol>
<li>
Open a command shell and navigate to the JDK installation directory. Navigate
to the <tt>/bin</tt> directory.</li>

<li>
Start the naming service by typing:</li>

<ol><tt>tnameserv -ORBInitialPort 1050</tt></ol>
Note: If the naming service returns an error message indicating that the
port is use, you can use a different port number, but make a note of it
- you will need to know it for the next procedure.
<li>
The naming service returns information on the command line that is similar
to the following:</li>

<ol><tt>Initial Naming Context:</tt>
<br><tt>IOR:000000000000002849444c3a6f6d672e6f72672f436f734e616d696e672f4</tt>
<br><tt>e616d696e67436f6e746578743a312e30000000000100000000000000300</tt>
<br><tt>00100000000000774696d2d7773000006db000000000018afabcafe00000</tt>
<br><tt>002cbb35b05000000080000000000000000</tt>
<br><tt>TransientNameServer: setting port for initial object references
to: 1050</tt></ol>
</ol>
A simple way to get this IOR into the naming service browser is to cut
it to the clipboard. Note that you want the string beginning with <tt>IOR</tt>
and ending at the last non-blank character before <tt>TransientNameServer</tt>.
After copying the IOR to the clipboard you can either:
<ul>
<li>
Start the Naming Service Browser and paste the IOR from the clipboard to
the Naming Service Browser's startup dialog.</li>

<li>
Paste the IOR from the command shell into a text editor, and save it to
a text file. You can then start the Naming Service Browser and specify
this text file in the Naming Service Browser's startup dialog.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="Set Up the Naming Service Browser"></a>Starting the Naming Service
Browser</h3>
To use Forte for Java's Naming Service Browser with the naming service
process that you started earlier:
<ol>
<li>
Switch to the Runtime tab of the Explorer.</li>

<li>
Right click the CORBA Naming Service node and choose Bind New Context from
the context menu. A dialog will appear which allows you to tell the naming
service browser how to find the service.</li>

<li>
Enter the following: in the Name field&nbsp; "JDK"; in the Kind field,
"Naming."</li>

<li>
There are two ways to supply the naming service IOR:</li>

<ul>
<li>
If you copied the IOR to a file, type the URL for the file (using <tt>file:///&lt;path
to your file></tt> ) into the URL field.</li>

<li>
Paste the IOR that you cut from the command line into the IOR field.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Click OK to close the dialog. A new node, named JDK, will appear under
CORBA Naming Service. The Naming Service browser is now communicating with
the naming service process you specified.</li>
</ol>
