<h2>
CORBA Project Settings</h2>
There are a number of project settings that affect the operation of the
CORBA module. There are two groups of settings:
<ul>
<li>
General CORBA settings, which apply to all operations with the CORBA module.</li>

<li>
ORB product settings, which apply when you are generating source files
for use with a particular ORB product.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<b>Accessing CORBA Project Settings</b></h4>

<ol>
<li>
From the main window, choose Project <img src="arrow.gif"> Settings.</li>

<li>
On the Project Settings dialog, click on the "CORBA Settings" node. This
will display the general settings in the right half of the dialog. These
settings apply to all operations with the CORBA module.</li>

<li>
Click on the CORBA Settings node to expand it and see its subnodes.</li>

<li>
Notice that there is a subnode for each of ORB product supported by the
CORBA module. Click on a subnode. This will display the settings that are
applied when you use one ORB product in the right half of the dialog. These
settings control how source files are generated when you specify the ORB
product represented by the node.</li>
</ol>
