<h2>Accessing CORBA Settings</h2>

<ol>
<li>
From the main window, choose Tools 
<img src="../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choose">&nbsp;Options.</li> 

<li>
In the Options dialog box, expand the Distributed Application Support node 
and select CORBA Support Settings. 
<p>
The property sheet, in the right half of the Options dialog
box, displays the ORB Version property. Use this property to specify
the ORB product for which you are developing.  The CORBA module
generates code that works with the specified ORB. This setting applies
to all operations with the CORBA module.</p></li>

<li>
Expand the CORBA Support Settings node to see its subnodes.</li>

<li>
Click a subnode (there is a subnode for each ORB product supported by
the CORBA module). This displays the settings that are applied when
you use the selected ORB product in the right half of the dialog
box. These settings control how source files are generated when you
specify the ORB product represented by the node.</li>
