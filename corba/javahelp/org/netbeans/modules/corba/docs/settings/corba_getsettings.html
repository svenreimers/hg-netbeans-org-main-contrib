<h2>Accessing CORBA Project Settings</h2>

<ol>
<li>
Choose Project <img src="../images/arrow.gif"> Settings.</li>

<li>
In the Project Settings dialog box, click CORBA Settings. 
<p>
The property sheet, in the right half of the Project Settings dialog
box, displays the ORB Version property. Use this property to specify
the ORB product for which you are developing.  The CORBA Module
generates code that works with the specified ORB. This setting applies
to all operations with the CORBA module.</p></li>

<li>
Expand the CORBA Settings node to see its subnodes.</li>

<li>
Click a subnode (there is a subnode for each of ORB product supported by the
CORBA module). This displays the settings that are
applied when you use one ORB product in the right half of the dialog box. These
settings control how source files are generated when you specify the ORB
product represented by the node.</li>
