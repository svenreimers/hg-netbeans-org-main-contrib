<h2>
ORB Product Subnode Settings</h2>
These properties appear when you select a subnode of the CORBA Settings
node.
<h3>
Properties Tab</h3>

<h4>
Client Binding</h4>
Use this property to specify what kind of code should be generated for
binding the client to a server.
<ul>
<li>
Naming Service -- Generate client code that obtains a server reference
from a naming service.</li>

<li>
IOR From File -- Generate client code that reads a server reference
from a file.</li>

<li>
IOR From Standard Input -- Generate client&nbsp; code that reads a
server reference from standard input.</li>

<li>
Proprietary Binder -- Generate&nbsp; client&nbsp; code that works with
the proprietary binding methods defined by the ORB vendor. This is available
when you are using OrbixWeb 3.2, Orbacus for Java 3.1.x, and VisiBroker
for Java.</li>
</ul>
When you are developing both the client and the server, you should use
the same binding type for both the client and server sides. If you are
developing a client that uses an existing server, you have to choose
the type of binding that works with the server.
<h4>
Generated Skeletons</h4>
Use this property to specify whether the skeleton code generated from your
IDL file should be inheritance-based or tie-based.
<ul>
<li>
Inheritance Based -- The implementation class is an extension of the skeleton
class, as in:</li>

<ul>class HelloImpl extends _HelloImplBase</ul>

<li>
Tie Based -- The implementation class has no direct relationship with the
skeleton class, as in:</li>

<ul>class HelloImplTIE implements _HelloOperations</ul>
In this case, a tie class, such as _HelloTie, establishes the relationship
between the implementation class and the skeleton class.</ul>

<h4>
Generation</h4>
Use this property to specify what kind of implementation code should be
generated for operations (methods) declared in your IDL file:
<ul>
<li>
Generate Nothing -- Generate empty method bodies for operations (methods)
declared in the IDL.</li>

<li>
Generate Exception -- In each method body, generate a statement that throws
an invalid exception.</li>

<li>
Generate "Return Null" -- In each method body, generate a "return null"
statement.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Hide Generated Files</h4>
Use this property to specify whether the stubs and skeleton files generated
from you IDL by the IDL compiler will be visible in the IDE.
<ul>
<li>
True -- The stub and skeleton files are not visible in the Explorer window.
Since you rarely edit these files or reference them directly in your code,
you might prefer that they be invisible.</li>

<li>
False -- The stub and skeleton files are visible in the Explorer window.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Parameters for IDL compiler</h4>
Use this property to set up any parameters you want to pass to the IDL
compiler. Anything you type in this property is passed to the IDL
compiler when it is executed.
<h4>
Server binding</h4>
Use this property to specify what kind of code should be generated on the
server side for preparing a reference to the implementation instance/servant
object:
<ul>
<li>
Naming Service -- Generate server code that registers a reference to
the implementation instance/servant object with a naming service.</li>

<li>
IOR From File -- Generate server code that writes a reference to the
implementation instance/servant object to a file.</li>

<li>
IOR To Standard OutPut -- Generate server code that writes the IOR
for the implementation instance/servant object to standard output.</li>

<li>
Proprietary Binder -- Generate server code that works with the proprietary
binding methods defined by the ORB vendor. This is available when you are
using OrbixWeb 3.2, Orbacus for Java 3.1.x, and VisiBroker for Java.</li>
</ul>
The client side must use the same binding method. For example, if the server-side
code registers the implementation instance/servant object with the naming
service, the client must obtain its reference to the servant from the naming
service.
<h4>
Synchronization</h4>
Use this property to specify how the IDE should behave when you modify
an IDL definition. Depending on the setting, the IDE displays
a dialog box that enables you to synchronize IDL and implementation:
<ul>
<li>
Disabled -- The IDE will not prompt you to synchronize IDL and implementation.</li>

<li>
On Update -- When you edit an IDL file, open its contextual menu, and choose
either the Update Implementation or Update and Generate Implementation
command, you are prompted to synchronize the IDL and its implementation.
(If you modify an IDL&nbsp; interface, the contextual menu will have the Update
Implementation command; if you add a new interface to the IDL file, the
contextual menu will have the Update and Generate Implementation command.)</li>

<li>
On Save Action -- When you edit and then save an IDL file, you will be
prompted to synchronize the IDL and its implementation.</li>
</ul>
Note that after modifying an IDL interface definition you also need to
recompile it, in order-- to regenerate the stub and skeleton classes.
<h3>
Expert Tab</h3>

<h4>
Column Position</h4>
Number of the group returned by the Error Expression (see below) that contains
the column of the offending code when the IDL compiler returns errors.
If your IDL compiler does not return this information, or your Error Expression
does not parse it, set this parameter to -1. A valid default value is supplied
for each supported ORB product; it is unlikely that you will need to change
it.
<h4>
Directory Switch for IDL Compiler</h4>
The switch passed on the command line to the IDL compiler to indicate that
what follows it is the directory in which it should put the files it generates.
A valid default is supplied for each supported ORB product and its IDL
compiler; it is unlikely that you will need to change it..
<h4>
Error Expression</h4>
A POSIX syntax regular expression which is used to parse the IDL compiler's
error output. It sorts the compiler's output into groups for error message,
column number, file name, and line number. A valid error expression is
supplied for each supported ORB product; it is unlikely you will need to
change it.
<h4>
Extended Class Postfix</h4>
A string used to build a name for the generated class that servers as the
base class for the implementation class. (In other words, the IDL compiler
generates a class that the implementation class must extend.) Each ORB
product has a naming convention for this base class, and therefore a valid
default value is supplied for each supported ORB product; it is unlikely
that you will need to change it.
<br>For an example, most ORB products use a prefix of&nbsp; "_" and a postfix
of "ImplBase" for the base classes they generate; if you compile an IDL
interface named Hello with one of these ORB products it generates a base
class named _HelloImplBase. And the actual implementation class will be
declared "extends _HelloImplBase."
<h4>
Extended Class Prefix</h4>
See Extended Class Postfix. A valid default value is supplied for each
supported ORB product; it is unlikely that you will need to change it.
<h4>
External IDL compiler</h4>
Use this property to identify the IDL compiler for a specific ORB product.
Type in either the full path to the IDL compiler, or, if the IDL compiler's
directory is included in the operating system's PATH environment variable,
just type in the executable's name.
<h4>
File Position</h4>
An integer value indicating which group in the Error Expression contains
the file name of the IDL source file that produced errors. See Error Expression.
<h4>
ImplBase Implementation Postfix</h4>
A string used to build a name for a generated implementation class to be
used with inheritance-based skeletons. Each ORB product has a naming convention
for this class, and therefore the IDE supplies a valid default value for
each supported ORB product; it is unlikely that you will need to change
it.
<br>For an example, most ORB products use no prefix and a postfix of "Impl"
for the implementation classes they generate; if you generate an implementation
class for an IDL interface named Hello with one of these ORB products it
generates an implementation class name HelloImpl.
<h4>
ImplBase Implementation Prefix</h4>
See Implementation Postfix. A valid default value is supplied for each
supported ORB product; it is unlikely you will need to change it.
<h4>
Implemented Interface Postfix</h4>
A string used to build a name for a generated tie interface to be used
with tie-based skeletons. Each ORB product has a naming convention for
this interface, and therefore a valid default value is supplied for each
supported ORB product; it is unlikely that you will need to change it.
<br>For an example, most ORB products use no prefix and a postfix of "Operations"
for the implementation classes they generate; if you generate a tie interface
for an IDL interface named Hello with one of these ORB products it generates
an interface named HelloOperations.
<h4>
Implemented Interface Prefix</h4>
See Implemented Interface Postfix. A valid default value is supplied for
each supported ORB product; it is unlikely you will need to change it.
<h4>
Line Position</h4>
An integer value indicating which group in the Error Expression contains
the line number of the source code that the IDL compiler could not process.
See Error Expression.
<h4>
Message Position</h4>
An integer value indicating which group in the Error Expression contains
the error message. See Error Expression.
<h4>
Package Delimiter</h4>
The character used to separate package names in commands passed to the
IDL compiler. This is the "." character (as in java.awt) for all currently
supported ORB products.
<h4>
Package Switch for IDL Compiler</h4>
The string that the IDL compiler recognizes as the command line switch
which to be followed by the name of the package for files generated by
compiler.
<h4>
Template Table</h4>
The templates contain text tags that are replaced when code is generated.
These tags are delimited by two underscore characters on each side of them.
The template table consists of entries such as USER=JOEBLOW. Whenever __USER__
is encountered when the user creates a new class from the template, it
is replaced by JOEBLOW.
<h4>
Tie Implementation Postfix</h4>
A string used to build a name for a generated implementation class for
use with tie-based skeletons. Each ORB product has a naming convention
for this class, and therefore a valid default value is supplied for each
supported ORB product; it is unlikely that you will need to change it.
<br>For an example, most ORB products use no prefix and a postfix of "ImplTIE"
for the tie-based implementation classes they generate; if you generate
a tie-based implementation class for an IDL interface named Hello with
one of these ORB products it generates an implementation class name HelloImplTIE.
<h4>
Tie Implementation Prefix</h4>
See Tie Implementation Postfix. A valid default value is supplied for each
supported ORB product; it is unlikely you will need to change it.
<h4>
Tie parameter</h4>
Line switch included on the command line to the IDE's Implementation Generator;
tells the Implementation Generator to generate classes for use with tie-based
skeleton instead of inheritance-based skeleton.
