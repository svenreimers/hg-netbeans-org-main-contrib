<h2>ORB Product Subnode Settings</h2>

<p>
These properties appear when you select a CORBA Settings subnode
in the Projects Setting window.</p>

<h3>Properties Tab</h3>


<h4>Client Binding</h4>
<p>
Specifies what kind of code is generated for
binding the client to a server.
<ul>
<li><b>Naming Service.</b> Generates client code that obtains a server
reference from a naming service.</li> 

<li><b>IOR From File.</b> Generates client code that reads a server reference
from a file.</li>

<li><b>IOR From Standard Input.</b> Generates client code that reads a
server reference from standard input.</li>

<li><b>Proprietary Binder.</b> Generates client code that works with
the proprietary binding methods defined by the ORB vendor. This option
is available when you are using OrbixWeb 3.2, Orbacus for Java 3.1.x,
or VisiBroker for Java.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
When you are developing both the client and the server, use
the same binding type for both the client and server sides. If you are
developing a client that uses an existing server, you have to choose
the type of binding that works with the server.</p>

<h4>CPP Parameters</h4>
<p>
Sets up parameters (such as <tt>-I</tt> to specify a path to
include files) to pass to the preprocessor in the IDL parser.
</p>

<h4>Delegation Type</h4>
<p>
Specifies the object type whose definition is used at runtime.
<ul>
<li><b>None.</b> No inheritance occurs. Empty method bodies are
generated.</li>  

<li><b>Static.</b> Methods of the base class are called
indirectly by the derived class.</li>

<li><b>Virtual.</b> Methods of the base class are called directly by
the derived class.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Generated Skeletons</h4>
<p>
Specifies whether the skeleton code generated from your
IDL file is inheritance-based or tie-based.
<ul>
<li><b>Inheritance Based.</b> The implementation class is an extension of
the skeleton class, as in:
<pre>
 class HelloImpl extends _HelloImplBase
</pre></li>

<li><b>Tie Based.</b> The implementation class has no direct
relationship with the skeleton class, as in:
<pre>
 class HelloImplTIE implements _HelloOperations
</pre>
In this case, a tie class, such as <tt>_HelloTie</tt>, establishes the
relationship between the implementation class and the skeleton class.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Generation</h4>
<p>
Specifies what kind of implementation code is
generated for operations (methods) declared in your IDL file:
<ul>
<li><b>Generate Nothing.</b> Generates empty method bodies for
operations (methods) declared in the IDL.</li>

<li><b>Generate Exception.</b> In each method body, generates a
statement that throws an invalid exception.</li>

<li><b>Generate <tt>Return Null</tt>.</b> In each method body, generates a
<tt>return null</tt> statement.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Hide Generated Files</h4>
<p>
Specifies whether the stubs and skeleton files generated by the IDL
compiler are visible in the IDE. 
<ul>
<li><b>True.</b> The stub and skeleton files are not visible in the
Explorer window. Since you rarely edit these files or reference them
directly in your code, you might prefer that they be invisible.</li>

<li><b>False.</b> The stub and skeleton files are visible in the Explorer
window.</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Parameters for IDL compiler</h4>
<p>
Sets up any parameters you want to pass to the IDL
compiler. Anything you type in this property is passed to the IDL
compiler when it is executed.
</p>

<h4>Server Binding</h4>
<p>
Specifies what kind of code is generated on the
server side for preparing a reference to the implementation instance
or servant object:
<ul>
<li><b>Naming Service.</b> Generates server code that registers a reference to
the implementation instance/servant object with a naming service.</li>

<li><b>IOR From File.</b> Generates server code that writes a reference to the
implementation instance/servant object to a file.</li>

<li><b>IOR To Standard OutPut.</b> Generates server code that writes the IOR
for the implementation instance/servant object to standard output.</li>

<li><b>Proprietary Binder.</b> Generates server code that works with
the proprietary binding methods defined by the ORB vendor. This option is
available when you are using OrbixWeb 3.2, Orbacus for Java 3.1.x, or
VisiBroker for Java.</li> 
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The client side must use the same binding method. For example, if the
server-side code registers the implementation instance or servant object
with the naming service, the client must obtain its reference to the
servant from the naming service.</p>

<h4>Synchronization</h4>
<p>
Specifes how the IDE behaves when you modify
an IDL definition. Depending on the setting, the IDE displays
a dialog box that enables you to synchronize IDL and implementation.
<ul>
<li><b>Disabled.</b> The IDE does not prompt you to synchronize IDL and
implementation.</li> 

<li><b>On Update.</b> When you edit an IDL file, open its contextual menu,
and choose either the Update Implementation or Update and Generate
Implementation command, you are prompted to synchronize the IDL and
its implementation. (If you modify an IDL interface, the contextual
menu includes the Update Implementation command. If you add a new
interface to the IDL file, the contextual menu includes the Update
and Generate Implementation command.)</li>

<li><b>On Save Action.</b> When you edit and then save an IDL file,
you are prompted to synchronize the IDL and its implementation.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
After modifying an IDL interface definition you also need to
recompile it to regenerate the stub and skeleton classes.</p>

<h4>Use Guarded Blocks</h4>
<p>
Enables you to protect portions of code that the CORBA module outputs
with guarded (highlighted) blocks.
<ul>
<li><b>True.</b> Delegated methods are put in guarded blocks and cannot be
edited.</li> 

<li><b>False.</b> Delegated methods are available to be edited in the
source.</li>  
</ul></p>

<h3>Expert Tab</h3>

<h4>Column Position</h4>
<p>
Specifies the number of the group returned by the Error Expression
property that contains the column number of the offending code. If your
IDL compiler does not return this information, or your Error
Expression does not parse it, set this parameter to -1. A valid
default value is supplied for each supported ORB product; you probably
will not need to change the default.
</p>

<h4>Directory Switch for IDL Compiler</h4>
<p>
Provides the switch passed on the command line to the IDL
compiler. The switch indicates that the following entry is the
directory in which the generated files should be stored. A valid
default is supplied for each supported ORB product and its IDL
compiler; you probably will not need to change the default.
</p>

<h4>Error Expression</h4>
<p>
Specifies a POSIX syntax regular expression that is used to parse the
IDL compiler's error output. The expression sorts the compiler's
output into groups for error message, column number, file name, and
line number. A valid error expression is supplied for each supported
ORB product; you probably will not need to change the default.</p>

<h4>Extended Class Postfix</h4>
<p>
Specifies a string used to build a name for the generated class that
serves as the base class for the implementation class. (In other
words, the IDL compiler generates a class that the implementation
class must extend.)  Each ORB product has a naming convention for this
base class.  A valid default value is supplied for each
supported ORB product; you probably will not need to change the default.</p>

<p>
For example, most ORB products use a prefix of "_" and a postfix of
<tt>ImplBase</tt> for the base classes they generate. If you compile
an IDL interface named <tt>Hello</tt> with one of these ORB products,
it generates a base class named <tt>_HelloImplBase</tt>. The actual
implementation class is declared as <tt>extends_HelloImplBase</tt>.</p>

<h4>Extended Class Prefix</h4>
<p>
See Extended Class Postfix. A valid default value is supplied for each
supported ORB product; you probably will not need to change the default.
</p>

<h4>External IDL Compiler</h4>
<p>
Identifies the IDL compiler for a specific ORB product.
Type in the full path to the IDL compiler or, if the IDL compiler's
directory is included in the operating system's <tt>PATH</tt>
environment variable, just type in the executable's name.</p>

<h4>File Position</h4>
<p>
Provides an integer value indicating which group in the Error
Expression contains the file name of the IDL source file that produced
errors. See Error Expression.</p>

<h4>ImplBase Implementation Postfix</h4>
<p>
Specifies a string used to build a name for a generated implementation
class to be used with inheritance-based skeletons. Each ORB product
has a naming convention for this class. The IDE supplies
a valid default value for each supported ORB product; you probably
will not need to change the default.
<p>
For example, most ORB products use no prefix and a postfix of
<tt>Impl</tt> for the implementation classes they generate. If you
generate an implementation class for an IDL interface named
<tt>Hello</tt> with one of these ORB products, it generates an
implementation class named <tt>HelloImpl</tt>.</p>

<h4>ImplBase Implementation Prefix</h4>
<p>
See Implementation Postfix. A valid default value is supplied for each
supported ORB product; it is unlikely you will need to change it.</p>

<h4>Implemented Interface Postfix</h4>
<p>
Specifies a string used to build a name for a generated tie interface
to be used with tie-based skeletons. Each ORB product has a naming
convention for this interface. A valid default value is
supplied for each supported ORB product; you probably
will not need to change the default.
<p>
For example, most ORB products use no prefix and a postfix of
<tt>Operations</tt> for the implementation classes they generate. If
you generate a tie interface for an IDL interface named <tt>Hello</tt>
with one of these ORB products it generates an interface named
<tt>HelloOperations</tt>.

<h4>Implemented Interface Prefix</h4>
<p>
See Implemented Interface Postfix. A valid default value is supplied
for each supported ORB product; you probably
will not need to change the default.</p>

<h4>Line Position</h4>
<p>
Provides an integer value indicating which group in the Error
Expression contains the line number of the source code that the IDL
compiler could not process.  See Error Expression.</p>

<h4>Message Position</h4>
<p>
Provides an integer value indicating which group in the Error
Expression contains the error message. See Error Expression.</p>

<h4>Package Delimiter</h4> 
<p>
Specifies the character used to separate package names in commands
passed to the IDL compiler. This is the "." character (as in
<tt>java.awt</tt>) for all currently supported ORB products.</p>

<h4>Package Switch for IDL Compiler</h4>
<p>
Specifies the string that the IDL compiler recognizes as the command
line switch. This switch is followed by the package name for files
generated by the compiler.</p>

<h4>Template Table</h4> 
<p>
Specifies a value for a template text tag. The templates contain text
tags that are replaced when code is generated. These tags are
delimited by two underscore characters on each side of them. The
template table consists of entries such as
<tt>USER=JOEUSER</tt>. Whenever <tt>__USER__</tt> is encountered when
the user creates a new class from the template, it is replaced by
<tt>JOEUSER</tt>.</p>

<h4>Tie Implementation Postfix</h4>
<p>
Specifies a string used to build a name for a generated implementation
class for use with tie-based skeletons. Each ORB product has a naming
convention for this class, and therefore a valid default value is
supplied for each supported ORB product; you probably
will not need to change the default.</p>
<p>
For example, most ORB products use no prefix and a postfix of
<tt>ImplTIE</tt> for the tie-based implementation classes they
generate; if you generate a tie-based implementation class for an IDL
interface named <tt>Hello</tt> with one of these ORB products it
generates an implementation class name <tt>HelloImplTIE</tt>.</p>

<h4>Tie Implementation Prefix</h4>
<p>
See Tie Implementation Postfix. A valid default value is supplied for
each supported ORB product; you probably will not need to change the
default.</p>

<h4>Tie parameter</h4>
<p>
Provides the line switch included on the command line to the IDE's
Implementation Generator and tells the Implementation Generator to
generate classes for use with a tie-based skeleton instead of an
inheritance-based skeleton.
</p>

<h4>Value Factory Implementation Postfix</h4>
<p>
Specifies a string used to build a name for a generated implementation
class for use with inheritance-based skeletons. Each ORB product has a
naming convention for this class. A valid default factory value is
supplied for each supported ORB product; you probably will not need to
change the default.</p>
<p>
For example, most ORB products use no prefix and a postfix of
<tt>ValueFactoryImpl</tt> for the value factory implementation classes
they generate. If you generate a value factory implementation class
for an IDL interface named <tt>Hello</tt> with one of these ORB
products, it generates an implementation class named
<tt>HelloValueFactoryImpl</tt>. You can supply a postfix designator
(for example, <tt>_M_</tt>) by entering the designation in the Value
Factory Implementation Postfix property.
<table>
<tr valign="top">
<td><img src="../images/tip.gif"></td>
<td>
If the postfix you designate does not appear, make sure that
the ORB for Compilation property for your IDL corresponds to the same
ORB for which you have set the postfix. Right-click the IDL file in the
Explorer, click Properties in the contextual menu, and click the
Compilation tab in the Properties window to verify the ORB.
</td> 
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<h4>Value Factory Implementation Prefix</h4>
<p>
See Value Factory Implementation Postfix. A valid default value is
supplied for each supported ORB product; you probably will not need
to change the default. You can supply a prefix designator (for example,
<tt>_M_</tt>) by entering the designation in the Value Factory
Implementation Prefix property.</p>

<h4>Value Implementation Postfix</h4>
<p>
Specifies a string used to build a name for a generated implementation
class for use with inheritance-based skeletons. Each ORB product has a
naming convention for this class. A valid default value is supplied
for each supported ORB product; you probably will not need to change
the default.</p>
<p>
For example, most ORB products use no prefix and a postfix of
<tt>ValueImpl</tt> for the value implementation classes they generate.
If you generate a value implementation class for an IDL interface
named <tt>Hello</tt> with one of these ORB products, it generates an
implementation class named <tt>HelloValueImpl</tt>. You can supply a
postfix designator (for example, <tt>_M_</tt>) by entering the
designation in the Value Implementation Postifx property.
<table>
<tr valign="top">
<td><img src="../images/tip.gif"></td>
<td>
If the postfix you designate does not appear, make sure that
the ORB for Compilation property for your IDL corresponds to the same
ORB for which you have set the postfix. Right-click the IDL file in the
Explorer, click Properties in the contextual menu, and click the
Compilation tab in the Properties window to verify the ORB.
</td> 
</tr>
</table></p>

<h4>Value Implementation Prefix</h4>
<p>
See Value Implementation Postfix. A valid default value is supplied
for each supported ORB product; you probably will not need to change
the default. You can supply a postfix designator (for example,
<tt>_M_</tt>) by entering the designation in the Value Implementation
Prefix property.</p>
