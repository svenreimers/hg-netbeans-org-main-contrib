<h2>
Starting the Interface Repository Browser</h2>
The Interface Repository Browser enables you to view the contents of a
running interface repository. The IDL interfaces are represented by subnodes
of the browser node. You can select a node and have the browser copy the
interface into your IDE flesystem.
<p>To start the Interface Repository Browser and view a naming service,
you need the interface repository's IOR.
<h3>
Obtaining the Interface Repository IOR</h3>
If the interface repository is being managed by a system administrator,
the interface repository IOR will probably be stored in a well-known file.
Specify this file when you start the Interface Repository Browser.
<p>If you are managing the interface repository yourself, you need to obtain
an IOR when you start the interface repository from the command line. A
simple way to get this IOR into the Interface Repository Browser is to
cut it to the clipboard. Note that you want the string beginning with <tt>IOR</tt>
and ending at the last non-blank character before <tt>Interface Repository</tt>.
After copying the IOR to the clipboard you can either:
<ul>
<li>
Start the Interface Repository Browser and paste the IOR from the clipboard
to the Interface Repository Browser's startup dialog.</li>

<li>
Paste the IOR from the command shell into a text editor, and save it to
a text file. You can then start the Interface Repository Browser and specify
this text file in the startup dialog.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="Set Up the Naming Service Browser"></a>Starting the Interface Repository
Browser</h3>
To use the Interface Repository Browser with the interface repository process
that you started earlier:
<ol>
<li>
Switch to the Runtime tab of the Explorer Window.</li>

<li>
Right-click the CORBA Interface Repository node and choose Add Interface
Repository from the context menu. A dialog will appear which allows you
to tell the naming service browser how to find the service.</li>

<li>
Enter a name to identify the interface repository in the IDE.</li>

<li>
There are two ways to supply the interface repository IOR:</li>

<ul>
<li>
If you copied the IOR to a file, type the URL for the file (using <tt>file:///&lt;path
to your file></tt> ) into the URL field.</li>

<li>
Paste the IOR that you cut from the command line into the IOR field.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Click OK to close the dialog. A new node, with the name you specified,
will appear under the CORBA Interface Repository Node. The Interface Repository
browser is now communicating with the interface repository process you
specified.</li>
</ol>
