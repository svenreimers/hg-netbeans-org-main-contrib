<h2>
Generating Client-side Files</h2>
You can generate client-side files with either the CORBA wizard or the
CORBA templates. Before generating any code, make sure the IDE is set up
for the ORB product you want your CORBA programs to work with.
<h4>
<b>Using the CORBA Wizard</b></h4>

<ol>
<li>
From the main window, choose Tools&nbsp;<img SRC="arrow.gif" height=13 width=6>
CORBA Wizard to open the first page of the CORBA Wizard.</li>

<li>
On this page::</li>

<ol>
<li>
Type in the name of the IDL file on which your client program will be based.
This can be either an existing file or a new file (which you create on
page three of the wizard).</li>

<li>
Select the package in which you want the wizard to put the files it generates.</li>
</ol>

<li>
On the second page of the wizard, indicate which files the wizard should
generate:</li>

<ul>
<li>
If you are writing a client for an existing server, check only the Create
Client box.</li>

<li>
If you are writing a client for an existing server, your client will be
based on an existing IDL file and you do not need to check the Create IDL
box.</li>
</ul>

<li>
On the third page of the wizard, choose the settings that describe the
implementation that your client will be working with.</li>

<br>If you are writing a client for an existing server, you need to know
whih binding method the server uses and whether the server is tie-based
or inheritance-based.
<li>
On the fourth page of the wizard, identify the IDL on which your client
program will be based.</li>

<ul>
<li>
If the IDL is in a file, click the Browse button and select the file.</li>

<li>
If the IDL is in an interface repository, browse the CORBA Interface Repository
node and select the correct interface. (To do this, you must have already
started the CORBA vendor's interface repository and started up the CORBA
Module's Interface Repository Browser.)</li>
</ul>

<li>
On the fifth page of the wizard, review the description of the actions
the wizard will take, and click the Finish button to begin code generation.</li>

<br>If you are generating a client for an existing server, the description
will read, "The CORBA Wizard will now import IDL, generate Client."
<li>
The CORBA Module generates a local copy of the IDL you specified and a
java source file named <tt>&lt;IDL_interface_name>Client</tt>. For example,
if you specified <tt>hello.idl</tt>, the wizard will create a local copy
of <tt>hello.idl</tt> and <tt>helloClient.java</tt>.</li>
</ol>

<h4>
<a NAME="new"></a><b>Using the CORBA Templates</b></h4>

<ol>
<li>
From the main window, choose File&nbsp;<img SRC="arrow.gif" height=13 width=6>
New to open the Template Chooser.</li>

<li>
From the CORBA template category, select the <tt>ClientMain</tt> template.</li>

<li>
Use the fields on the right side of the Template Chooser to specify both
a name for your client file and the package in which it should be generated.</li>

<li>
Click the Finish button.</li>

<br>The CORBA module creates a CORBA client source file, named <tt>&lt;Name_You_Input>.java</tt>.
<li>
In addition to generating client program source code with the template,
you need to copy the IDL on which your client is based to the client program's
package.</li>
</ol>
