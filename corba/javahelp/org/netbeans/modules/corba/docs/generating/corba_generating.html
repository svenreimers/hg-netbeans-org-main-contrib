<h2>
Using the IDE to Generate CORBA Files</h2>
The IDE provides two tools for generating CORBA program source files, the
CORBA templates and the CORBA wizard. You can generate the files you need
with either of these tools, as described in the following topics.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="corba_generating_client.html">Generating Client-side Files</a></li>

<li>
<a href="corba_generating_server.html">Generating Server-side Files</a></li>
</ul>
