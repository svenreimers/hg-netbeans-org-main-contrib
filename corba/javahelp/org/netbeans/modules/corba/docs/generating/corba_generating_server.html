<h2>
Generating Server-side Files</h2>
You can generate server-side files with either the CORBA wizard or the
CORBA templates. Before generating any code, make sure the IDE is set up
for the ORB product you want your CORBA programs to work with.
<p><b>Using the CORBA Wizard:</b>
<ol>
<li>
From the main window, choose Tools&nbsp;<img SRC="arrow.gif" height=13 width=6>
CORBA Wizard to open the first page of the CORBA Wizard.</li>

<li>
On this page, you:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Type in the name of the IDL file on which your server program will be based.
This can be either an existing file or a new file (which you create on
page three of the wizard).</li>

<li>
Select the package in which you want the wizard to put the files it generates.</li>
</ul>

<li>
On the second page of the wizard, indicate which files the wizard should
generate:</li>

<ul>
<li>
If you are writing a server based on existing IDL interface, check the
Create Server and Create Implementation boxes.</li>

<li>
If you are writing both the IDL interface and the server program, check
the Create IDL,</li>

<br>Create Server and Create Implementation boxes.
<li>
If you are writing the IDL interface, and a server program that uses it,
and a client program, check the Create IDL, Create Server, Create Implementation,
and Create Client boxes.</li>
</ul>

<li>
On the third page of the wizard, choose the settings that describe the
implementation that you want to generate.</li>

<li>
The appearance of the wizard's fourth page depends on whether you are using
existing IDL or writing new IDL (whether you checked the Create IDL box):</li>

<ul>
<li>
If you are using existing IDL, the wizard will let you identify the IDL.
If the IDL is in a file, use the file browser to specify the file. If the
IDL is in an interface repository, browse the CORBA Interface Repository
node and select the correct interface. (To do this, you must have already
started the CORBA vendor's interface repository and started up the CORBA
Module's Interface Repository Browser.)</li>

<li>
If you are writing new IDL, the wizard has buttons that add IDL with the
correct syntax.</li>
</ul>

<li>
On the fifth page of the wizard, review the description of the actions
the wizard will take, then click the Finish button to begin code generation.</li>

<br>The CORBA Module generates a local copy of the IDL you specified and
java source files named <tt>&lt;IDL_interface_name>Server</tt>. For example,
if you specified <tt>hello.idl</tt>, the wizard will create a local copy
of <tt>hello.idl</tt> and two .java files named <tt>helloServer.java</tt>
and <tt>helloImpl.java</tt>.</ol>
<b>Using the CORBA Templates:</b>
<ol>
<li>
From the main window, choose File&nbsp;<img SRC="arrow.gif" height=13 width=6>
New to open the Template Chooser.</li>

<li>
From the CORBA template category, select the <tt>ServerMain</tt> template.</li>

<li>
Use the fields on the right side of the Template Chooser to specify both
a name for your server file and the package in which it should be generated.</li>

<li>
Click the Finish button.</li>

<li>
The CORBA module creates a CORBA server source file, named <tt>&lt;Name_You_Specified>.java</tt>.</li>

<li>
In addition to generating server program source code with the template,
you need to copy the IDL on which your server is based to the server program's
package.</li>
</ol>
