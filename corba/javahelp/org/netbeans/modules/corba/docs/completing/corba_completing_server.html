<h2>Completing Server-side Files</h2>

<p>
After you generate the server-side CORBA program files, there is some
coding to do to complete the Implementation Class and the Server
Class.</p>


<h3><a name="completing_impl"></a>Completing the Implementation Class</h3>

<p>
If you generated your implementation class with the CORBA wizard, you
must add method bodies to the implementation class's business methods
(the methods declared in the IDL).</p>

<p>
Implementation classes can also have private methods (not declared in
the IDL) that are called by the business methods. If you generated
your server program with the CORBA templates, you must code your
implementation class by hand.</p>

<h3><a name="completing_server"></a>Completing the Server Class</h3>

<p>
The code you must add to your server class depends on the 
binding method it uses:
<ul>
<li>
For all binding methods, you must add code that 
instantiates the implementation class and connects it to the ORB.</li>
<li> 
If your server class writes the IOR to standard output, you must add code that 
converts the IOR to string form and writes it to standard output.</li>
<li> 
If your server class writes the IOR to a file, you must add code that converts 
the IOR to string form and writes it to a file that you specify.</li>
<li> 
If your server class registers the IOR with a naming service, you must add code 
that specifies the name to which the IOR will be bound in the naming
service operation.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Adding Code That Instantiates the Implementation Class and Connects It to the ORB</h4>

<ol>
<li>
Look for the following comment near the top of your generated server class:
<pre>
 // add code to instantiate your object implementation here
</pre>
</li>

<li> 
Below that comment, add a line of code like the following example,
which instantiates an implementation class to create a servant
instance: 
<pre>
 HelloImpl helloServant = new HelloImpl();
</pre>

<li> 
Look for the following line in your generated server class:
<pre>
 orb.connect (/* add your object implementation here */);
</pre>
</li>

<li> 
Replace the comment with the name you used for the servant
instance. For example:
<pre>
 orb.connect (helloServant);
</pre>
</li></ol>

<h4>Adding Code That Writes the IOR to Standard Output</h4>

<ol> 
<li> 
Look for the following line in your generated server class:
<pre>
 System.out.println (orb.object_to_string (/* place your object 
 implementation here */));
</pre></li>

<li> 
Replace the commented parameter with your servant instance, as in the
following example:
<pre>
 System.out.println (orb.object_to_string (helloServant));
</pre></li>
</ol>

<h4>Adding Code That Writes the IOR to a File</h4>

<ol>
<li>
Look for the following lines in your generated server class:
<pre>
 String ior = orb.object_to_string (/* place your object
 implementation here */);
 try { 
      FileWriter file = new java.io.FileWriter("<file_name>");
      ...
</pre></li>
<li>
Replace the commented parameters with your servant instance and the
name of the file to which you want to write the IOR, as in the
following example:
<pre>
 String ior = orb.object_to_string (helloServant);
 try {
      FileWriter file = 
           new java.io.FileWriter("helloServant.ior");
      ...
</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<h4> Adding Code that Specifies the Binding Name</h4>
<ol> 
<li> 
Start the naming service with which you plan to register your server.</li>
<li> 
In the IDE, switch to the Explorer window's Runtime tab.</li>
<li> 
Start the CORBA Module's Naming Service Browser, specifying the
naming service you started in the previous step.</li> 
<li> 
You can register your server in an existing naming context or
create a new context for it.  
<p>To create a new naming context: 
<ol>
<li>
Right-click the node for the JDK Naming Service, and from the
contextual menu, choose Create New Context. This opens a small dialog box.</li>
<li> 
In the Name and Kind fields, enter names that desribe the context you
are creating, and click OK. 
<p>
Another new sub-node appears underneath the one for the JDK naming
service. You have just created a naming context in which you will
register your servant instance.</p>
<p>
The names you use in this step are arbitrary--they are chosen to be
descriptive.
</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li>  
Right-click the node that represents the naming context in which you are registering 
the server, then from the contextual menu, choose Copy Server Binding Code.</li>
<li> 
Switch back to the editing window, and look for the following comment in your generated 
server class:
<pre>
 // paste code retrieved using the Copy Server Code action (on a context node in 
 the Naming Service Browser)
</pre></li>
<li>
Position the cursor under this line, and press Ctrl-V.
<p>
The code you pasted registers an object with the naming service and naming
context you selected with the Naming Service browser.</li> 
<li>
Complete the pasted code by supplying the name that will be used for your
servant instance, as follows: 
<ol>
<li>
Look for the <code>&lt;name of server&gt;</code> variable. Replace it with " "
for the servant name.</li>  
<li>
Look for the <code>&lt;kind of server&gt;</code> variable. Replace it with
<code>demo</code>. 
<p>
(These names are arbitrary and are chosen to be descriptive of the
application.)</li>
</ol></li> 
<li>
Locate the following comment:
<pre>
 nc.bind (aName, /* place here name of servant variable */);
</pre></li> 
<li> 
Replace the commented parameter with <code>hImpl</code> so the line looks like
this:
<pre>
 nc.bind (aName, hImpl);
</pre>
</li>
</ol> 

<h4> Compiling Your Server</h4> 

<p>
The last step in completing the server is to compile all the classes
related to the server, including the IDL file, together:
<ul>
<li>Right-click the node for the package, and select Compile from the contextual
menu.</li>
</ul>
