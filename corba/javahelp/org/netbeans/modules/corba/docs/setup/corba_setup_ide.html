<h2>
Specifying the ORB You Are Using</h2>
For the CORBA module to generate stub and skeleton files that will work
with a particular ORB product, you need to set properties identify that
ORB product:
<ol>
<li>
Open the Project Settings dialog box by choosing Project > Settings from the
main menu.</li>

<li>
Locate the CORBA Settings node and click it. The CORBA settings appear
on the right half of the dialog box.</li>

<li>
Make sure that the ORB Version property is set to the ORB you will be using.</li>

<li>
Leave the Project Settings window open, and click the CORBA Settings
node to display its sub-nodes.</li>

<li>
Click the sub-node for the ORB you are using; the properties for that
ORB appear in the right half of the dialog box.</li>

<li>
When you develop CORBA programs, the IDL compiler generates stub, skeleton,
and other supporting files and puts them in the package with the file you
actually write. You do not reference these files directly in code you write,
so by default they are hidden. If you want to see them, set the Hide Generated
Files property to false.</li>

<li>
Make sure the other properties, such as the Generated Skeletons property,
are set to values that are appropriate for your project.</li>

<li>
If you are going to specify the external IDL compiler executable as a property:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Click the Expert tab.</li>

<li>
Click External IDL Compiler, then click the ellipsis ("...") symbol.</li>

<li>
Type in the full path to the IDL compiler.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
Note that these settings apply to the current development project. Different
projects can be configured differently.
