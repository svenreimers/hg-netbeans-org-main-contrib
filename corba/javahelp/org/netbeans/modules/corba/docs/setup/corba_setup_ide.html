<h2>Specifying an ORB</h2>

<p>
For the CORBA module to generate stub and skeleton files that 
work with a particular object request broker (ORB) product, you need
to set properties that identify that ORB product.
</p>
<p>
<b>To examine and modify CORBA property settings:</b>
<ol>
<li>Choose Tools <img src="../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choose">&nbsp;Options.</li> 

<li>Expand Distributed Application Support and select CORBA Support Settings. 
The CORBA properties appear
on the right of the dialog box.</li> 

<li>Make sure that the ORB Version property is set to the ORB that you
want to use.</li> 

<li>Expand the CORBA Settings node to display its subnodes.</li> 

<li>Click the subnode for the ORB you are using. The properties for that
ORB appear in the right of the dialog box.
<p>
When you develop CORBA programs, the IDL compiler generates stub,
skeleton, and other supporting files and puts them in the package with
the file you actually write. You do not reference these files directly
in the code you write, they are hidden by default. If you want to
see them, set the Hide Generated Files property to False.</p></li>

<li>Make sure the other properties, such as the Generated Skeletons property,
are set to values that are appropriate for your project.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<b>To specify the external IDL compiler executable as a property:</b>
<ol>
<li>Choose Tools 
<img src="../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choose">&nbsp;Options.</li> 
<li>Expand Distributed Application Support <img src="../images/expand.gif" alt="and
expand">&nbsp; CORBA Support Settings.</li> 
<li>Select the node for your ORB. Then select the Expert tab on the property
sheet.</li>
<li>Click External IDL Compiler, then click the ellipsis ("...") button.</li>
<li>Type in the full path to the IDL compiler.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Any changes that you make to these settings apply to the current development project. Different
projects can be configured differently depending on the properties
available for the selected ORB.
