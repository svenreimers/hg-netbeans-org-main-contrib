<h2>
Supported ORB Products</h2>
The CORBA module can generate code for use with the following ORB products:
<ul>


<li>
OrbixWeb 3.2 for Java</li>

<li>
Orbix 2000 for Java</li>

<li>
VisiBroker for Java 3.4</li>

<li>
VisiBroker 4.x</li>

<li>
JDK 1.2 ORB</li>

<li>
JDK 1.3 ORB</li>

<li>
J2EE ORB</li>

</ul>

<p>The module can also generate code for use with other ORB products. However 
work with other ORB products is not supported.</p>
<p>To generate code for use with a particular ORB, the ORB itself and the
ORB supplier's IDL compiler must be installed on the development machine.
The other "setup" topics explain how to set up the IDE for the ORB product
you are using.
