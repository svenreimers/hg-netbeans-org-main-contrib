<h2>
Setting Up the Naming Service Browser</h2>
The CORBA module's CORBA wizard or CORBA templates generate most of the
code for CORBA programs. The templates and wizard do not generate all of
the code for naming service interaction, because you need to specify the
name to which you are binding the servant instance and the context in which
you are binding it..
<p>The Naming Service Browser is an additional&nbsp; tool that generates
server-side binding or client-side lookup code for you. The Naming Service
Browser interacts with a running name service instance, so you need to
set it up each time you want to use it.
