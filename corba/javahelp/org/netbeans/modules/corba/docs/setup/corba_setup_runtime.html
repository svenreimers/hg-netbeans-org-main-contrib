<h2>Accessing the ORB Runtime Classes</h2>

<p>
To run CORBA programs, each process needs to access the classes that
make up the ORB runtime. If you are using the JDK ORB (1.2 or 1.3),
the ORB is included in the JDK and the ORB runtime classes are
accessible from the IDE. If you are using the J2EE Reference
Implementation, the J2EE ORB runtime is included in the Reference
Implementation.</p>

<p>
If you are using any other ORB implementation, you need to make sure
that the runtime classes supplied with your ORB are available to your
development projects in the IDE. For a list of the runtime classes,
and their directory locations within the ORB installation, refer to
the ORB product's documentation.
</p>
<p>
<b>To select the ORB classes you want:</b>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the Filesystems node in the IDE's Explorer window.
<li>Choose either Mount Jar Archive or Mount Directory,
depending on which format the ORB vendor used for the classes.</li>

<li>Use the browser field to select the ORB classes.</li>
</ol>
</p>
