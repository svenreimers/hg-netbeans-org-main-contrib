<h2>
Accessing the ORB Runtime Classes</h2>
To run CORBA programs, each process needs to access the classes that make
up the ORB runtime. If you are using the JDK ORB (1.2 or 1.3), the ORB
is included in the JDK and the ORB runtime classes are already accessible
from the IDE. If you are using the J2EE Reference Implementation, the J2EE
ORB runtime is included in the Reference Implementation.
<p>If you are using any other ORB implementation, you need to make sure
that the runtime classes supplied with your ORB are available to your 
development
projects in Forte for Java:
<ol>
<li>
For a list of the runtime classes, and their directory locations within
the ORB installation, refer to the ORB product documentation.</li>

<li>
In the IDE's Explorer window, locate the Filesystems node.</li>

<li>
Right-click it and choose either Add Jar Archive or Add Directory,
depending on which format the ORB vendor used for the classes.</li>

<li>
Use the browser field to select the ORB classes.</li>
</ol>
