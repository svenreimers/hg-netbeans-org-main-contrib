<h2> Setting up the IDL Compiler</h2><P>To generate stub and skeleton files, you 
need to compile your IDL source file with an IDL compiler. Each ORB vendor supplies 
an IDL compiler that will generate stubs and skeletons that are compatible with 
its ORB runtime.</P><P> Set up the IDE as described below to cause a compile command 
issued on an IDL file (or on a package containing an IDL file) to execute the 
correct IDL compiler:</P><P>The ORB vendor's documentation should identify the 
IDL compiler executable. There are two ways to set your environment up so that 
you can execute the IDL compiler from inside the IDE: </P><ul> <li> Add the directory 
containing the IDL compiler executable to your operating system's PATH variable.<P>&nbsp; 
</P></li><li> Specify the full path to IDL compiler in the IDE's CORBA properties. 
<P>(See the instructions for <a href="corba_setup_ide.html">setting the IDE's 
CORBA properties</a>.)</P></li></ul><P>After you have set up your environment, 
issuing compile commands on files with the .idl extension will execute the appropriate 
IDL compiler. <BR></P><TABLE WIDTH="550" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2"><TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD><IMG SRC="../images/tip.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="12"></TD><TD>If

and install it. The download includes documentation for installation and usage.
