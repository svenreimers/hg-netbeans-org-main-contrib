<h2>
Using the CORBA Module</h2>
The CORBA module generates most of the Java source code you need for CORBA
client and server programs. Because this is a complex process, the procedures
you follow to create CORBA programs are outlined below:
<ol>
<li>
Before generating any code, complete the installation and setup procedures.</li>

<br>(See <a href="../setup/corba_setup.html">CORBA Module Setup</a>)
<li>
Obtain or write the IDL source file that defines the interfaces for your
CORBA programs.</li>

<ul>
<li>
If you are using the CORBA templates to generate code, generate your IDL
file first.</li>

<li>
If you are using the CORBA wizard to generate code, you can use the wizard
to write your IDL as part of the process that generates the Java source
files.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Decide which Java source files you need generated, client-side, server-side
or both.</li>

<li>
Use either the CORBA wizard or the CORBA templates to generate the files.</li>

<li>
Add the code that completes the generated classes::</li>

<ul>
<li>
On the client side, add the code that requests a specific IOR from the
naming service. When the server is running, you can use the CORBA module's
Naming Service Browser to generate this code for you and paste it into
your client class file.</li>

<li>
On the server side, add the code that binds the servant instance to the
naming service. You can use the CORBA module's Naming Service Browser to
generate this code for you and paste it into you server class file.</li>

<li>
Also on the server side, add business logic to the generated implementation
class.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Compile the IDL file.</li>

<li>
Compile, run and test your programs.</li>
</ol>
