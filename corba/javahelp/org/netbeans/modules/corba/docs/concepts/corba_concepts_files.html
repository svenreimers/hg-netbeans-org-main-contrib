<h2>
&nbsp;Files Required for Java-language CORBA Programs</h2>
The CORBA module has a CORBA wizard and several CORBA templates. You can
use either tool to generate Java source files (.java files) for the different
parts of CORBA programs. The type of program you are writing determines
which files you need.
<h4>
<b>IDL Files</b></h4>
You always need an IDL file, which defines the interface of a CORBA server.
The CORBA module lets you use an existing IDL file or write your own.
<ul>
<li>
If you are writing a client program that will use CORBA technology to access
a CORBA server that someone else has already developed and deployed, you
begin with a copy of the IDL used by the server developer.</li>

<li>
If you are developing a complete CORBA application, you probably begin
by writing your own IDL.</li>
</ul>
The CORBA template mechanism creates a blank IDL file that you complete
in the IDE's editing window. The CORBA wizard provides more support for
writing IDL; it has buttons that add IDL elements in correct IDL syntax.
<h4>
<b>Client-side Files</b></h4>
The files you need for a client-side program are:
<ul>
<li>
A client class</li>

<br>This class has a <tt>main()</tt> method that obtains an IOR for a CORBA
server. You can generate a client class with either the CORBA templates
or the CORBA wizard. After generating a client class, you need to add code
that uses the IOR to invoke server methods and handles return values.
<li>
The stub classes</li>

<br>These classes are generated when you compile the IDL file.</ul>
If you are writing a client program to access an existing CORBA server,
you need a copy of the IDL file that the server developer wrote.
<h4>
<b>Server-side Files</b></h4>
The files you need for a server-side program are:
<ul>
<li>
An implementation class.</li>

<br>This class contains the business logic that can be executed by clients.
It is called the implementation class because it contains implementations
of the methods declared in the IDL interface. You can generate an implementation
class with either the CORBA templates or the CORBA wizard. After generating
it, you need to add code that implements the business logic.
<li>
A server class.</li>

<br>This class has a <tt>main()</tt> method that instantiates the implementation
class (creates the servant instance), registers the servant instance with
the ORB, and makes the servant instance's IOR available to clients. Either
the CORBA templates or the CORBA wizard can generate a server class for
you. After generating a server class, you need to complete the code that
makes the servant's IOR available to clients.
<li>
The skeleton classes.</li>

<br>These classes are generated when you compile the IDL file.</ul>
If you are using the CORBA Wizard to generate your server files, the wizard
will help you write the IDL file as part of the complete process. If you
are using the CORBA templates, you should generate and complete your IDL
file before generating the other server-side files.
