<h2>Java Files for CORBA Programs</h2>

<p>
The CORBA module provides a CORBA wizard and several CORBA templates. You
can use either tool to generate Java source files (<tt>.java</tt>
files) for the different parts of CORBA programs. The type of program
you are writing determines which files you need.
</p>

<h3>IDL Files</h3>
<p>
You always need an interface definition language (IDL) file, which
defines the interface of a CORBA server. The CORBA module lets you use
an existing IDL file or write your own. 
<ul>
<li>
If you are writing a client program that uses CORBA technology to access
a CORBA server that someone has already developed and deployed, 
begin with a copy of the IDL used by the server developer.</li>

<li>
If you are developing a complete CORBA application, begin
by writing your own IDL.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The CORBA template enables you to create either a blank IDL file that you can
complete in the IDE's editing window or one that you can add elements
to using the IDL wizard. It enables you to add IDL elements
in correct IDL syntax.
</p>

<h3>Client-Side Files</h3>
<p>
The files you need for a client-side program are:
<ul>
<li>A client class.
<p>
This class has a <tt>main()</tt> method that obtains an IOR for a CORBA
server. You can generate a client class with the CORBA templates
or the CORBA wizard. After generating a client class, you need to add code
that uses the IOR to invoke server methods and handles return values.</p></li>
<li>Stub classes.
<p>
These classes are generated when you compile the IDL file.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If you are writing a client program to access an existing CORBA server,
you need a copy of the IDL file that the server developer wrote.
</p>

<h3>Server-Side Files</h3>
<p>
The files you need for a server-side program are:
<ul>
<li>An implementation class.
<p>
This class contains the business logic that can be executed by
clients.  It is called the implementation class because it contains
implementations of the methods declared in the IDL interface. You can
generate an implementation class with the CORBA templates or
the CORBA wizard. After generating the class, you need to add code that
implements the business logic.</p></li> 
<li>A server class.
<p>
This class has a <tt>main()</tt> method that instantiates the
implementation class (creates the servant instance), registers the
servant instance with the ORB, and makes the servant instance's IOR
available to clients. You can generate a server class with the CORBA
templates or the CORBA wizard. After generating a server
class, you need to complete the code that makes the servant's IOR
available to clients.</p></li> 
<li>Skeleton classes.
<p>
These classes are generated when you compile the IDL file.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If you are using the CORBA templates, you should generate and
complete your IDL file before generating the other server-side
files. If chose the Empty IDL template, you can use the New From
Template wizard to write the IDL file. If chose the Simple IDL
template, you can complete the IDL file manually in the Source Editor.
