CORBA Basics</h2>
CORBA technology allows an object in one process to invoke the methods
of another object running in another process. The basic parts of programs
that use CORBA technology are shown in the illustration that follows.
<br><img SRC="CORBA1.gif" height=251 width=526>
<br>The role that each part plays in a CORBA program is summarized below:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Client Class</b> Invokes a method that will be executed in the server
process. Note that a complete client-side application might consist of
more classes than the CORBA client class.</li>

<li>
<b>Stub Classes</b> Used on the client side to convert the client class's
method invocation into a format that can be delivered over a network connection.</li>

<li>
<b>ORB Classes</b> Manage the transmission and delivery of method invocations
between processes.</li>

<li>
<b>Implementation Class</b> Contains the server's business logic. An instance
of this class, known in CORBA terms as the <i>servant</i>, is registered
with the ORB. Methods of this instance can be executed by clients running
in other processes.</li>

<li>
<b>Server Class</b> Instantiates the implementation class (creates the
<i>servant</i>). The server class also takes a reference to the servant
instance and makes it publicly available by registering the reference with
a naming service, or by writing the reference to standard output, or by
writing the reference to a specified file. This reference is known in CORBA
terms as interoperable object reference, or
<i>IOR</i>.</li>

<li>
<b>Skeleton Classes</b> Used on the server side to convert a method invocation
from the wire format generated by the stub classes and transmitted by the
ORB into a format that can be read by the servant instance.</li>
</ul>
Note: CORBA is a complex technology and a comprehensive account of it is
outside the scope of this document. If you are developing CORBA programs
and you are not familiar with the technology, you will do well to look
at any of the books that have been written on CORBA and Java.
