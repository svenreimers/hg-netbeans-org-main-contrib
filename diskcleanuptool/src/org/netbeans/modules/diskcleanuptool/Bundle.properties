OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    A  module to delete large directories without consuming disk and processor resources.  \
    I designed this module because I am often deleting large Netbeans source distributions.  \
    I sometimes have a cleanup session or what ever you call it.  \
    This consumes my disk IO and makes other processes run slower.  \
    This tool helps get around that while being able to delete old files and cleanup my hard drive. \n\n\
    Once installed. \
    Click on a directory in any view and choose "Delete without limiting system (CPU and Disk Friendly)". \
    The directory will be deleted. \
    While deleting progress will be shown in the NetBeans progress bar. \
    THERE IS NO UNDO, SO BE SURE WHAT YOU WANT TO DELETE IS WHAT YOU "REALLY" WANT TO DELETE!
