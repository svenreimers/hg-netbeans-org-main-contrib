        <h2>Using VCS with IDE Projects</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
        <p>The IDE's VCS support enables developer groups to synchronize project-specific 
        metadata as well as the source files that make up their applications. Using 
        VCS, you can place project metadata, such as project properties files and Ant 
        build scripts, under version control.</p>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>The physical location of each project in relationship
            to the location of projects and libraries on its classpath must be exactly
            the same on every machine the project is checked out to. If any references
            are broken, the IDE displays a warning when you open the project. To avoid
            broken references, it is advisable to  ensure that the location of projects
            in the VCS repository  matches their location when they are checked
            out to a local working directory.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>IDE Project Metadata Files</h3>
        <p>Depending on project type, the IDE generates different metadata files and stores 
        them in the <tt>nbproject</tt> directory. The types of project metadata files 
        in the IDE include: 
        <ul>
            <li><tt>nbproject</tt> directory 
            <ul>
                <li><tt>project.xml</tt> 
                <li><tt>build-impl.xml</tt> (standard projects only) 
                <li><tt>genfiles.properties</tt> (standard projects only)
                <li><tt>project.properties</tt> (standard projects only)
                <li><tt>private</tt> directory (standard projects only)
            </ul>
  
            <li><tt>build.xml</tt>
        </ul>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You should not place your <tt>private</tt> directory
            into the VCS repository, as it contains information that is specific
            to your system's IDE installation. The IDE automatically
            ignores the <tt>private</tt> directory
            when running VCS commands. In addition, you should  not put your 
            <tt>dist</tt> or <tt>build</tt> directories
            into the repository.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>To place IDE project metadata under version control: </b> </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Register the directory that contains the project as a VCS working directory. 
            For more information, see <a href="vcs_repositorysetup.html">Setting 
            Up VCS</a>. 
            <li>In the Projects window, right-click your project's node and choose Clean 
            Project to delete the <tt>build</tt> and <tt>dist</tt> directories.
            <li>Add the project metadata to the VCS repository. If you are using CVS, for 
            example, open the Files window (Ctrl-2), right-click the application's topmost 
            node, and choose CVS > Add.
            <li>In the Add dialog box, select Add All Local Files in Folder Contents and 
            select Add the Folder Contents Recursively. Click OK.
            <p><b>Note:</b> the IDE automatically ignores the <tt>private</tt> directory
            and any files that are already in the CVS repository. 
            <li>Commit the project metadata to the VCS repository. If you are using
            CVS, right-click the topmost application node in the Files window and choose
            CVS > Commit.    
            <li>Enter a message 
            describing your changes to the repository in the Commit dialog and click
            OK.
            <p>The IDE uploads the new files to the repository and the  VCS Ouput window
            opens to display the progress.
