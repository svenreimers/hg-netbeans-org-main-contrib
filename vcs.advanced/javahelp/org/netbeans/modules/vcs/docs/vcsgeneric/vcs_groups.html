        <h2>Using VCS Groups</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>VCS groups simplify the process of working with version-controlled files by
        organizing related files together. Once organized into groups, you can use
        the
        VCS Groups window to track changed files, prepare groups of files
        for check-in, and perform VCS commands on the entire group.</p>
        <p>To open the VCS Groups window, choose Window > Versioning > VCS
        Groups from the main window.</p>
        <h3>Adding Files to VCS Groups</h3>
        <p>You can add files to a group manually using the Include in VCS Group command
        or have them added automatically whenever they are altered. 
        <h4>To add files to the Default Group automatically:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Right-click the top-level VCS Groups node and choose Properties. 
            <li>In the VCS Groups property sheet, select Move Modified Files to Default
            Group in the Auto Addition combo box. 
        </ol>
        Files are automatically added to the Default
        Group whenever they are changed. If necessary, you can then move the files
        to another group.</p>
        <h3>Preparing Grouped Files for Check-in to the Repository</h3>
        
<p>Prior to committing a group of files to the repository, you can use the Verify 
  command to insure that each of the files exist in the repository, are up to 
  date (CVS only), and have been changed. </p>
        <h4>To verify a group of files for check-in: resolve
        any problems with your grouped files</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Right-click the node of the group containing the files you want to verify
            and choose Verify. The Group Verification dialog box opens, displaying all
            files found to have problems  sorted under one of four tabs:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Do Add</b></li>
                <li><b>Do Update</b></li>
                <li><b>Not Locked</b></li>
                <li><b>Not Changed</b></li>
            </ul>
            <li>In each tab, select the  check box to activate the
            radio buttons' functions if necessary. 
            <li>Select the files you wish to include in each tab's file list and select
            the appropriate radio buttons. 
            <li>After configuring settings for each tab, click Correct Group. 
            <p>The IDE carries out the specified commands and displays a status report in the VCS Ouput window.
        </ol>
        <ul class="note">
        <li>To resolve all of the problems with grouped files
        simultaneously, set all of the options on all of the tabs in the Group
        Verification dialog box before you click Correct Group. </li></ul>
        <h3>Adding and Removing VCS Groups</h3>
        <p>By default, the VCS Groups window contains the Default group alone, however,
        you can also create additional groups within which to organize your versioned
        files. 
        <h4>To create a VCS group:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>  Right-clicking the top-level VCS
            Groups node and choose Add VCS Group.
            <li> Enter the desired name for the group and click OK.
            <p>The IDE the list of available groups in the VCS Groups window. 
        </ol>
