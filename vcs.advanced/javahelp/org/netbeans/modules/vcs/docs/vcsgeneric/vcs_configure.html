        <h2>Configuring Version Control Settings</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>The IDE allows you to edit both global VCS settings and settings specific
        to a local VCS working directory. The Versioning customizer allows you to edit
        VCS settings and other advanced options for a VCS working directory. You can
        also configure global VCS settings in the IDE's Options window. </p>
        <h4>To edit settings for a local VCS working directory:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose Versioning > Versioning
            Manager.
            <li>In the Versioning Manager, open the VCS working directory's customizer
            by selecting it's node and choosing Edit.
            <li>In the Profile Tab, select the profile  for the VCS
            program you are using from the list of those currently installed
            in the Version Control System Profile
            combo box. 
            <p><b>Note:</b> the remaining settings
            differ depending on which profile is currently selected. 
            <!--<li>If you want to save the current setup, you can do so as a new profile by clicking Save As, entering the file name
            and profile label, and clicking Save.</li>-->
            <li>Edit any settings you wish to change.</li>
            <li>(Optional) In the Advanced Tab, select any advanced options you require.
            </li>
            <li>(Optional) In the Environment Tab, disable any system environment variables
            you don't want to use with the IDE. You can also create and edit user-defined
            environment variables.
            <p><b>Note:</b> Most environment variables must be set outside
            of the IDE.
            <li>(Optional) In the Properties Tab, configure any of the version control system's
            environment variables you want to use with the IDE.
            <li>Click OK to close the customizer.
                <p>The IDE applies the settings to the designated local working directory. 
            </li>
        </ol>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>Changes made in the customizer apply only to the
            local working directory for which they are set. </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>To edit global VCS settings:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose Tools > Options
            from the main window.</li>
            <li>In the Options window, expand the Source Creation and Management node and
            select  the Version Control Settings node.</li>
            <li>Enter the settings for the options you require.
            <p>You can configure the following options:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Advanced Mode  Notification.</b> If true, enables prompting for advanced
                options when invoking VCS commands. </li>
                <li><b>Auto Refresh.</b> Sets the frequency with which versioned directories
                automatically refresh file status information. It is recommended that you
                set this property to For Newly Opened Folders because automatic refreshes
                on large directories can take a long time.</li>
                <li><b>File Status Annotation Display.</b> Sets the whether or not files'
                status annotations are displayed and at what level of detail. </li>
                <li><b>Home Directory.</b> Sets the location  corresponding
                to the system's <tt>HOME</tt> directory.
                This directory is used as the location for configuration files, such as the <tt>.cvspass</tt> file
                for CVS filesystems.</li>
                <li><b>Offline Mode. </b>If True, disables automatic refreshing of status information.
                File status information is still available with
                the Refresh command.</li>
                <li><b>Override  Settings of Versioned Directories. </b>If True, ignores options
                set for specific working directories. Changes are applied to
                new versioned directories only, existing working directories are not affected.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>If you need to edit VCS commands for a profile, expand Version Control
            Settings > Generic VCS Profiles,
            select the profile's node, and click the ellipsis (...) for the appropriate
            property.
            <p>The IDE applies the settings to the designated VCS profile.
        </ol>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>You can also configure how a VCS working directory's
            versioning information is displayed by right-clicking its node (<img src="./images/vcsGeneric.gif" alt="Working Directory">)
            in the Versioning window and choosing Properties. </li>
        </ul>
