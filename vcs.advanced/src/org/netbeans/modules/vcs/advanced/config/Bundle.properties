OpenIDE-Module-Name=VCS Generic Command-Line Support
OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category=Version Control
OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=Enables you to integrate any version control system that has a command-line interface.
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=The VCS Generic Support module enables you to integrate any version control system for which there is a command-line interface (such as CVS, RCS, or SCCS) into the IDE. Support for individual version control systems can be added as profiles. Additional profiles can be downloaded from http://vcsgeneric.netbeans.org/profiles/index.html. Note that installing this module disables the built-in NetBeans 5.0 CVS support.
