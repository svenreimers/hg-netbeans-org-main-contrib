<h2>Setting the Runtime Classpath of JavaFX Projects</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>By default, the runtime classpath of each JavaFX project contains the project's compiled classes and everything in the 
  project's compilation classpath. For information on viewing the compilation
classpath, see <a href="../compile/javafx_comp_classpath.html">Managing the Classpath of JavaFX Projects</a>.

<p>If your project uses special libraries dynamically at runtime through an indirect 
  interface, you have 
to add these libraries to the runtime classpath. </p>

        <ul class="note">
        <li>For JavaFX projects that have a main class specified, the IDE automatically copies any JAR 
        files on the project's classpath to the <tt>dist/lib</tt> folder.
        The IDE also adds each of the JAR files 
        to the Class-Path element in the application JAR's <tt>manifest.mf</tt> 
        file. This simplifies running the application outside the IDE. </li>
        </ul>  
        
<p>You also have to adjust your 
  	runtime classpath if the runtime dependencies between your projects do not
	match the compilation dependencies between the projects. For example, imagine
	that project A compiles against project B, and project B compiles against project
	C, but project A does not compile against project C. This means that project
	A only has project B on its runtime classpath. If project A requires both project
	B and project C during execution, you have to add project C to project A's runtime
	classpath.
<p><b>To set the runtime classpath:</b>
<ol>
  <li>Right-click the project node in the Projects window and choose Properties.<br>
  Alternatively, you can select the project in the Projects window and select File &gt; <i>&quot;&lt;JavaFX_project_name&gt;&quot;</i> Properties from the main menu.  </li>
  <li>In the Project Properties dialog box, select the Libraries node in the
  	Categories pane. </li>
  <li>Select the Run tab in the dialog's right pane.</li>
  <li>Add the necessary elements to the project's runtime classpath by clicking
  	the appropriate button. You can add any of the following:
	<ul><li><b>Project.</b> The
      	build output, source files, and Javadoc files of another IDE project.
      	Adding a project to the classpath makes it dependent on the present project.
      	Whenever you clean or build the project, all of its dependent projects
      	are also cleaned or built.</li>
      <li><b>Library. </b>A collection
      	of binary files, source files, and Javadoc files.</li>
      <li><b>JAR file.</b> A JAR file or folder somewhere on your system.</li>
      <li><b>Folder</b></li>
  	</ul>
  </li>
  <li>
(Optional) Click the Move Up   and Move Down buttons to alter to the
   classpath priority.
</ol>
