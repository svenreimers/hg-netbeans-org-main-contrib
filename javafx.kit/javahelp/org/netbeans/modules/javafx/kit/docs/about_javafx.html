    <h1>About JavaFX  Script Applications</h1>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small> 

  <p>The  JavaFX Script™ plugin for the NetBeans IDE provides  features for programming in the JavaFX Script language.  The JavaFX Script programming language is  declarative and statically typed. It has the 
same code structuring, reuse, and encapsulation features  that make it possible to create and maintain very large programs using the Java 
technology. It
makes intensive use of the Java2D Swing GUI components and enables you to easily create  graphical user interfaces or GUIs. To learn more about the JavaFX Script language, see the links under 
"Tutorials" and "References" sections of the

  <p>Support for the JavaFX Script language in NetBeans IDE has the following features:</p>
  <h3 >Advanced Source Code Editor</h3>
<p>The language-aware  editor indents and completes  your source code written in the JavaFX Script 
language. The editor also performs semantic syntax highlighting, live parsing of your code, 
matches words and brackets, marks errors
and occurrences, and has code folding capability. It has a toolbar that includes controls to enable 
or disable the preview, syntax highlighting, or error detection features. For more information, see 
<a href="editing/editing_javafx_source.html">Editing JavaFX Script Source Files</a>.
<h3 >OpenJFX Compiler</h3>
<p>The OpenJFX™ Compiler is integrated with the JavaFX Script plugin and is used to compile JavaFX 
Script source code. Java source code that is included in the JavaFX projects are compiled with the 
Java compiler. The results of the compilation are placed into one JAR file, which can be used for 
deployment or distribution. For more information, see <a href="compile/javafx_comp_about.html">About Building JavaFX Script Applications</a>. </p>
<h3>Debugger</h3>
<p>Currently, the debugger feature included with the JavaFX Script plugin   only supports debugging Java source code that is included in a  JavaFX Script project. </p>
<h3>Preview Feature </h3>
<p>The JavaFX Script plugin includes a preview feature   that allows you to view the effects of the changes you make to your source code without having to build and run your application each time you make any changes.  If there are no compilation errors encountered and the source file represents a UI widget, changes you make in the source editor will be displayed in the canvas pane located just above the source editor pane.
