OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Helps copy and paste text from and to Java source code.  \
    This module works well with SQL or HTML or XML which needs to be embedded in Java source code or needs to be extracted from Java source code.  \
    Look for the "Java Text Copy and Paste" context menu inside Java source files.  \
    There are no default hot keys for the functionality.  \
    I suggest playing around with the different actions to get a feel for how they work\
    .\
    \  + signs are pre-pended at the beginning of lines of source to make hand editing of generated code easier.
