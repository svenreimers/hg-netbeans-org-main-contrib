    <html><head></head><body>\nHelps copy and paste text from and to Java source code.  \
    This module works well with SQL or HTML or XML which needs to be embedded in Java source code or needs to be extracted from Java source code.  \
    Look for the "Java Text Copy and Paste" context menu inside Java source files.  \
    There are no default hot keys for the functionality.  \
    I suggest playing around with the different actions to get a feel for how they work\
    .\
    \  + signs are pre-pended at the beginning of lines of source to make hand editing of generated code easier.\
    <br/><br/>\n\n<b>Version 1.1</b> added a new way to copy the text from the editor which keeps newlines in the selected text yet removes any newlines fromJ the actual Java sources.\
    <br/><br/>\n\n<b>Version 1.2</b> adds tested support for NetBeans 6.0 and corrects a bug which deals with concurrent access of the edited document. \
    The bug has not shown any issues yet, but possibly could as concurrent access could have unknown results.\
    <br/><br/>\n\n<b>Version 1.3</b> fixes an issue dealing with the context menu sorting and NetBeans 6.0.\
