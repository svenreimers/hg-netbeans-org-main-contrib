/**
 * Shared memory inter-process I/O.  An instance of Shmem owns a file, which
 * it reads and writes to.  In practice, a second Shmem instance in another
 * JVM reads and writes to the same file to pass messages between processes.
 * <p>
 * The current buffer size is 2048.  Into that file
 * are written "commands" - the meaning of these is up to the client.  Upon
 * a write, the thread that calls write() will block until the command has 
 * been "acknowledged" by another process also writing into the same file.
 * <p>
 * The file format is simple:  
 * <ul>
 * <li>One long which is a unique ID.  Each shmem has a unique ID.</li>
 * <li>An integer indicating the command code - may be any number except 0.</li>
 * <li>An integer indicating the following content length.  Must be less than
 *     MAX_BUFFER_SIZE (2048) - Long.SIZE + (Integer.SIZE * 2).</li>
 * <li>UTF-8 encoded string content of zero or more bytes up to the limit of the
 *     buffer.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Implementation notes:  Acknowledging is setting the command id in the buffer
 * to zero. An instance of Shmem does not see commands from itself - hasDataWaiting()
 * will never be true if the data currently in the buffer was produced by
 * (has the same UID as) this Shmem.
