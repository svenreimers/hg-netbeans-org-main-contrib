/** Classes implementing this interface can register themselves with
 * TimeoutRegistry, and have their doTimeout() methods called
 * at an interval they specify.
 * <P>
 * There is an explicit contract between Timeoutable and TimeoutRegistry
 * that, when initiating an action the results of which will be timed out
 * (such as showing a component that you want to be hidden on a timeout),
 * that at that time you will call TimeoutRegistry.confirmActive().
 * <P>
 * The reason for this is that, for performance and memory, the timer
 * thread expires if it is unused for a period of time.  ConfirmActive
 * restarts the thread if necessary.
 * <P>
 * To register a class with TimeoutRegistry, call the static 
 * TimeoutRegistry.registerObject (myTimeoutableInstance).  There is
 * an unregister operation as well - however, TimeoutRegistry stores
 * a weak reference to the object, so it is not imperative that you
 * unregister your object for it to be garbage collected.
 *<P>
 * This is not meant to be a general purpose timer architecture, but a 
 * lightweight, low overhead one for non-critical purposes.
