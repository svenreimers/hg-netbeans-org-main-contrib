LaTeX support
=============

Introduction:
-------------
The LaTeX support module allows editing LaTeX code in NetBeans IDE.
It is not a WYSIWYG editor, you have to edit your code by hand.
There are plenty of features, for example:
-code completion on:
 -(subset of) LaTeX commands and arguments of these
 -natural language words
 -\ref{} argument
 -\cite{} argument (parses BiBTeX file)
-"javadoc" help on LaTeX commands
-underlining spell-checker.
-LaTeX model/tree (limited usage)
-others

Note: currently the features focuse on the editor. I am planning
to create TeX project, but I am waiting for the new projects infrastructure.

Please, send feedback to: lahodaj@netbeans.org .

Requirements:
-------------
-NetBeans 3.5 (or equivalent)
-JDK1.4.1 (JDK1.4.0 not tested, JDK1.3.x won't work)
-lexer and editorbridge modules installed
 (http://lexer.netbeans.org/servlets/ProjectDownloadList)

Fast Installation:
------------------
0. Make sure you have installed the lexer and editorbridge modules
1. Copy modules docsup-syntax.jar and docsup.jar from
   dictionary docsup/netbeans/modules from this package
   into ${NB-USER-DIR}/modules.
2. Restart NetBeans.

In this case a few features are inaccesible:
-spell checker (all words are considered incorrect)
-code completion on words
-help on LaTeX commands

Installation:
-------------

Non-SPL code:

The LaTeX support may use two non-SPL resources:
-Dictionary
-Help on LaTeX

These resources are not required,
but some features will be inaccessible.

The (english) dictionary can be downloaded here:
http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/
(get SCOWL and choose one dictionary from this package)

The dictionary should be placed in:
docsup/external/dictionary.txt

The LaTeX help can be downloaded here:
http://www.emerson.emory.edu/services/latex/latex2e/latex2e_toc.html
(get latex2e.tar.gz)

The help should be placed in:
docsup/external/latex2e.tar.gz

Compiling non-SPL code:

The non-SPL code has to be "compiled" to be usable. It is possible to
compile it without recompiling whole module. Simply do:

cd docsup
ant compile-non-spl

Installation:

0. Make sure you have installed the lexer and editorbridge modules
1. Compile non-SPL code
2. Copy whole directory docsup/netbeans/modules into ${NB-USER-DIR}/modules.
3. Restart NetBeans

Bugs:
-----
This is bleeding edge of development. The only testing is done
during my writings. Be prepared that there may be nasty bugs.

I would like to ask you to send bugreports to lahodaj@netbeans.org.
