  <h1>Storage API</h1>
  
  This library provides an abstraction for storage of byte-based data, and
  implementations of Storage over Java NIO memory mapped files, arrays and byte buffers.
  <p>
  Primarily it is useful for cases where some storage mechanism is going
  to be used, but it may vary either on performance characteristics, or simply
  the implementor does not want to be tightly tied to a particular mechanism.
