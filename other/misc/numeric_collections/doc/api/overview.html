  <h1>Numeric Collections</h1>
  This library provides a few collections-like classes which operate over,
  and handle primitive types.  Primarily these are useful in performance
  sensitive situations and situations involving large amounts of data.
  Since these classes can take advantage of primitive arrays, it is also
  possible to make use of binary searches for fast indexing.  Typically
  they require numbers to be added in ascending order - but often it is 
  possible to organize data this way.
  <p>
  Essentially, these are a few classes originally written for high performance
  in the NetBeans 4.0 output window, which their author found so useful he
  kept copying them into other projects.  So they got a home of their own.
  <p>
  Generally what's here:
  <ul>
  <li><code>IntList</code> A list of integers, which must be sequenced in
   ascending order</li>
  <li><code>LongList</code> A list of longs, which must be sequenced in 
   ascending order</li>
  <li><code>IntMap</code> A map between two arrays of integers</li>
  <li><code>SparseIntList</code> A somewhat unusual list-like class, in which
   each element is assumed to take up a value of 1, unless some other value
   has been set.  Useful if you have large amount of data which is usually the same, and 
   occasionally has some elements for which a value > 1 is needed (originally
   used to save the wrap count of lines in the output window, only for those 
   lines that are were wrapped).  So you can have what appears to be a very
   large list, but only unique elements are actually saved.  So, for example,
   <pre>
   SparseIntList l = new SparseIntList();
   l.add (100, 5); //Means that index 5 is worth 100
   </pre>
   means that
   <pre>
   l.get(0) = 0;
   l.get(1) = 1;
   l.get(2) = 2;
   l.get(3) = 3;
   l.get(4) = 4;
   l.get(5) = 5;
   l.get(6) = 106;
   l.get(7) = 107;
   ...
   </pre>
   In fact, the only values being stored in the list are two integers - 5 for
   the index and 100 for the value.
  </li>
  </ul>
