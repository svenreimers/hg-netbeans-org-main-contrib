  <h1>Cache API</h1>
  The purpose of this library is to provide a convenient way to build data
  caches - that is, some data which is stored persistently, but has minimal
  retrieval overhead.
  <p>
  Essentially, a Cache acts as an indexed list of <code>java.nio.ByteBuffer</code>s
  which may have data appended, deleted or replaced.  They are
  optimized for data which mainly grows - that is, data is appended to the
  end.  If you are dealing with data in which arbitrary elements from 
  arbitrary positions may change frequently, this library is probably 
  not for you - but it may be
  worth exploring whether there are patterns in your data that can be 
  exploited to operate more in this fashion (batching deletions so they
  are infrequent).  The performance will be quite good.
  <p>
  Caches use NIO memory mapped files for their operation - so cached
  data is not on the java heap, but rather used in-place, taking maximum
  advantage of the operating system's memory manager.
  <p>
  Often you will want to have objects of some implementation class which 
  represent the data which is being cached.  The ideal implementation of such
  objects keeps them very lightweight - simply keep a reference to the Cache
  in the object's constructor, and in integer indicating the index of the
  entry.  On demand, parse/fetch/deserialize data from the cache.  A
  trivial example:
  <pre>
  public class CachedObject {
     private final Cache cache;
     private final int index;
     
     public CachedObject (Cache cache, int index) {
         this.cache = cache;
         this.index = index;
     }
     
     public MyObject getMyData() {
         ByteBuffer bb = cache.getBuffer(index);
         //parse the data and return something
     }
  }
  </pre>
  <p>
  The primary use case for Caches is where there is some large number of
  objects that need to be persisted, it is not desirable to create all
  of those objects on startup, and the objects should not take up much
  space, but the data needs to be quickly available
  on demand.
  <p>
  As a practical example of what this is used for, this class was originally
  created to enable local caching of mail messages - most message data is
  only interesting if a UI needs to display a message or its headers, and
  the common case is for messages to be added to a folder - delete operations
  are less common and can afford the (slight) additional overhead.
