OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=Attempts to diagnose OutOfMemoryErrors

OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=Attempts to diagnose OutOfMemoryErrors \
    using Petr Nejedly's Insane tool, by allocating enough memory to \
    walk the heap during startup, freeing it, stopping all threads and \
    dumping a heap snapshot and analyzing it when an OOME happens.  Might \
    even work, who knows.
