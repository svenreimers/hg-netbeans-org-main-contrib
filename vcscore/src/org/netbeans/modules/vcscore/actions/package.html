This package integrates VCS support with actions UI.

<h2>VCS Actions Package</h2>

TODO the package contains a lot of garbage. There are
various command actions: Add, Diff, Commit, History, Remove
and Update that seems useless. My observation is
that CommandMenu and VcsGlobalCommandAction action replaces them
as they can construct menu from {@link ComamndTree} descriptors.
There are also few non command related actions: group management,
opening revision explorer, versioning manager, versioning output.
There are inproperly placed they should go to repective packages,

<p>
{@link CommandMenu} class describes menu invoked command lifetime
(without a phase hidden in command.execute()). It's described
in {@link org.netbeans.modules.vcscore.commands} package.
