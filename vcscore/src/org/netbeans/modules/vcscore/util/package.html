This package provides declarative UI parsing and rendering engine.

<h2>VID User Interface</h2>

The package can parse <a href="http://vcscore.netbeans.org/doc.VCSUtilities.html">text format</a>
and present it to user.

TODO more data here.

<h3>Defaults Support</h3>

When used with profiles there are variables holding
command context that can be partially customized by user.
The command customization called from {@link CommandProcessor}
shows the VID UI. The VID UI is described by VIDecriptors that
map to subset of actual command variables. Some VIDescriptor
values are computed so these values cannot be stored
as literals.

<p>
Also there are variables that hold literal
values but are not actually visualized. It happens
for trivial vs expert mode. What values should
be stored to defaults and restored later on
in different mode? Two examples:


<h4>Update Command</h4>

<pre>
 ASK_FOR_EXPERT(PRUNE_EMPTY, ...
 ASK_FOR_EXPERT(CREATE_DIRS, ...
 ASK_FOR_EXPERT(RESET_STICKY, ...
 ASK_FOR_EXPERT(GET_CLEAN_COPY, ...
 ASK_FOR_EXPERT(FORCE_HEAD_MATCH, ...
 ASK_FOR_EXPERT(SEND_TO_STDOUT, ...
 PROMPT_FOR_EXPERT(TAG, ...
 PROMPT_FOR_EXPERT(DATE, ...
 SELECT_RADIO_EXPERT(MERGE_SELECTION, ...
 SELECT_COMBO_EXPERT(RCS_KFLAG, ...
 IF_VAR_EMPTY"recursionBanned"_IF_VAR_NON_EMPTY"FILES_IS_FOLDER"_ASK_FOR_EXPERT(RECURSIVE, ...
</pre>

<p>In trivial mode there is no component visible and no variable should be defined.
In expert mode there are all (possibly minus RECURSIVE) components visible and previous
value should be loaded.

<p>In both modes default values reloading should be defined by actual components visibility
(catching IF_VAR_EMPTY"recursionBanned"_IF_VAR_NON_EMPTY"FILES_IS_FOLDER"_ASK_FOR_EXPERT)
plus in trivial mode PRUNE_EMPTY and CREATE_DIRS. Here interesting situation happens
From user point of view value of PRUNE_EMPTY and CREATE_DIRS should be shared between
modes in spite of act that it's never visible in simple mode. Hopefully it could
be permit-able to ignored it here.

<h4>Add Command</h4>

<pre>
 SELECT_RADIO(FOLDER_CONTENTS, ...
 PROMPT_FOR(DESCRIPTION, ...
 IF_VAR_EMPTY"recursionBanned"_ASK_FOR(RUN_RECURSIVELY, ...
 ASK_FOR(DO_COMMIT, ...
 SELECT_RADIO_TRIVIAL(KFLAG_TRIVIAL, ...
 SELECT_COMBO_EXPERT(KFLAG_EXPERT, ...
</pre>

<p>In trivial mode there is simplified KFLAG component. In expert mode
these is full blown KFLAG component. RUN_RECURSIVELY can be possibly
hidden depending on execution context.

<p>Ideally defaults reloading should translate between KFLAG
trivial and expert modes. Actually it's permit-able to store
values for both modes. Note here we do not want to loose
trivial mode default in expert mode and vice versa. The storage
is not defined by pure components visibility.

<h4>Commit Command</h4>

<pre>
 PROMPT_FOR_FILE(TEMPLATE_FILE, ... {FILE_OUTPUT_OF_COMMIT_TEMPLATE_GETTER(0)} ...
 ASK_FOR_EXPERT(FORCE, ...
 PROMPT_FOR_EXPERT(BRANCH, ...
 ASK_FOR_EXPERT(RUN_MODULE_PROGRAM, ...
 IF_VAR_EMPTY"recursionBanned"_IF_VAR_NON_EMPTY"FILES_IS_FOLDER"_ASK_FOR_EXPERT(RECURSIVE, ...
</pre>

<p>In trivial mode there is only description text visible. The field value
it loaded dynamically by evaluating a template getter. There is nothing to
store as default - no button should be visible. In expert mode there are
visible additional components. RECURSIVE visibility depends on command execution
context.

<p>RECURSIVE shoud be shared between modes regardless it's visibility.
It's the same situation as with Update's PRUNE_EMPTY and CREATE_DIRS.

<h3>Defaults Scope Point of View</h3>

Currently defaults are stored on per profile basics.
Cleanly not all variables are suitable for per profile
reusing. As an example Update's TAG can be taken. It's
workdir specifics and it does not make sence to store it.
Moreover in CVS case it's defined by directory context
so it should be unspecified until user realy wants to
switch to another branch.
<p>
<small>Roughly spoken for CVS the whole defaults
propably degrade to equivalent of what is typically
stored in <tt>$HOME/.cvsrc</tt>.</small>

<h3>Defaults Support Summary</h3>

Values must be loaded on visibility basics. No invisible
value can be reloaded. It guarantees not ideal but
permit-able behavior. Values must be stored in a such a way
that old defaults are merged with existing defaults to avoid
loosing defaults for variables defined in other mode. Ideally
there should be variable convertors between modes but
merging is permit-able behavior.
<p>
Scope point of view probably reduces stored variables
even further, storing and reloading globally just variables
listed in a predefined list. This solution is used.

<p>
<small>
VARIABLE_DEFAULTS statement allows to define defaults handling.
It defines a list of pairs: variable name and its storage mode.
There are two storage modes USER that reloads variable value
regardless of mode (propagating from advanced to simple) and
EXPERT_USER that reloads expert variable in expert mode only.
<p>
E.g. CVS DIFF defines <code>VARIABLE_DEFAULTS(IGNORE_WHITE USER, IGNORE_SPACE USER, IGNORE_CASE USER, ADDITIONAL_OPTIONS EXPERT_USER)</code>
