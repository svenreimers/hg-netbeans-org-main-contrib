Uniforms access to versioning file attributes in remote
repositories and their local caching.

<h2>The VCS File Attributes Implementation</h2>

The implementation speedups VCS status access for
remote repositories. It caches last know repository
state. The state is assumed to not change too often.
Note that final state check reponsibility is on
particular VCS command. It's by nature distributed system
and no shared state information exists.
E.g. <code>cvs commit</code> must fail if someone have
commited the same file into repository 1ms before.

<p>
The implementaion has two high level goals:
<ul>
  <li>reliability (#39817) never report false statuses
  <li>performance and scalability (#41012) similar to local operations
</ul>

<p>
The package fulfils several contracts. It defines {@link FileProperties}
attribute descibing versioned file metadata. The attribute is integrated
to NB filesystems world using {@link Turbo} class and {@link TurboUtil}
utility class. {@link Statuses} class defines statuses assigned by
turbo if original status cannot be retrieved. It covers <tt>unknown</tt>
status used as fallback if no reliable status source exists.
<p>
Sibling {@link IgnoreList} class internaly parasites on <code>FileProperties</code>
attribute. More clean approach is shown with {@link RepositoryFiles} class
a courtesy to VCSFileSystem that supports <it>virtual files</it>. Both
classes somehow utilizies information sharing, eliminating dedicated
repository connections to address their highly specialized contracts.

<h3>Architectural Notes</h3>

<h4>FileObject Parameter</h4>
It works over {@link FileSystem}. It's expected that clients do not need
to store <code>FileProperties</code> for non-<code>FileObject</code>s.
E.g. it's safe to call <code>findResource(path)</code> in FileSystem
implementation except <code>children()</code>, <code>createData()</code>
and <code>createFolder()</code> methods.

<p><small>
There is a backdoor allowing to set the attribute for a <code>File</code>
to catch these <code>FileObject</code> prenatal situations. VCSFileSystem should
be the only client.
</small>

<h4>Two Layers</h4>
The implementation is a layer above <code>FileAttributeQuery</code> package.
It implements and registers <i>fallback</i> <code>FileAttributeProvider</code>
that can store <code>FileProperties</code> attribute.

<h4>Assertions and Tests</h4>
There are many asserts scattered all around the code guarding (un)documented
assumptions.
<p>
Special test VCS <code>testprofile</code> is created. It has backdoor operations,
programatically setting its state using XMLFS. It allows to simulate various
situations.

<h4>Postmortem Debuggibility</h4>
The contract consists from methods without behaviour modification
parameters. It uses a set of dedicated methods instead of a method
taking a strategy constant (passed all around code). It allows to
quickly analyze thread dumps (compare to <i>invisible</i> method parameters).
<p><small>
An exception exists here. A special care it taken to GUI thread,
most methods assert if called from it, others speed up operation by returning
intermidiate results (and firing an event later on). It does not complicate
thread dump reading.

<h3>Status</h3>

IMPLEMENTED, INTEGRATION IN PROGRESS - porting original cache clients. Famous OOME
sanity check passes. Status coherence NOT yet tested.

<p>
Existing client code contains new code paths guarded by <code>Turbo.implemented()</code>
checks. These are not ready to be used right now. There are still missing
following client code (filesystem and commands) conversions
(it obviously excludes cache and caching packages):
<ul>
  <li>VcsFilesystem.List.children() support for filtering out DEAD and scheduled files.
      In AFS.List context we cannot use FileObject keyed access. Try VisibilityQuery approach.
  <li>Documentation and tests are still immature.
  <li>RepositoryFiles (virtuals) does not catch externaly locally deleted files
</ul>
