<h2>The VCS File Attributes Implementation</h2>

The implementation speedups VCS operations on
remote repositories. It caches last know repository
state. The state is assumed to not change too often.

<p>
The {@link Turbo} and {@link IgnoreList} implementaions have two main abstract goals:
<ul>
<li>reliability (#39817), here achieved by simplicity
<li>performance and scalability (#41012) similar to local operations
</ul>

<p>
They are responsible for:
<ul>
<li>STATUS: keeping last known status (up-to-date, localy modified, ....)
<li>UNKNOWN: model unknown status
<li>NOTIFICATIONS: support exteral status change listeners
<li>UPDATED_ON: holding retrieval date of last known status
<li>LEVELS: client can put strategy contraints
<li>IGNORELIST: keep merged .ignorelists
<ul>

<h3>Simplifications</h3>

It works over {@link FileSystem} it's expected that we do not need
to store FilePropeties for non FileObjects. It's safe
to call <code>getRoot().getFileObject(path)</code> in FileSystem
implementation except <code>children(folderName)</code> method.

<p>
Disk layer use FileObject attributes to store data
instead of custom format. All recent file statuses persist.
TODO Default attributes implemenaion may be perfomance problem.

<p>
Memory layer is not hierachical but two simple plain maps
FileObject to FilePropeties. Refs map content is driven by
FileReference lifetime. Cache map holds few recent
values for unreachable fileobjects.

<p>
Threading - no extra thread is spawned. All operation are
done synchronously. Clients are warned that some methods
can hang forever. It may need to be fixed in future by setting
timeouts (and possibly killing worker threads). However client's
interface will stay the same.


<h3>Status</h3>

WORK IN PROGRESS - SHARING IDEA

<p>
Existing client code contains new code paths guarded by <code>Turbo.implemented()</code>
checks. These are not ready to be used right now. There are still missing
following client code (filesystem and commands) conversions
(it obviously excludes cache and caching packages):
<ul>
  <li>objectidentity package implements CacheHandlerListener, there is nothing like that in
     simplified implementation
  <li>VcsFileSystem.getRealStatus() used in search, it also implements CacheHandlerListener
     to perform refresh
  <li>cvsprofiles.list package STATUS_DEAD management, where should it be defined? Also VcsFilesystem.List.children().
  <li>vcscore.commans package STATUS_IGNORED management, where should it be defined?
  <li>VcsFactory.getStatusProvider() and getCacheProvider() replacements not investigated yet
  <li>RefreshCommandSupport in VCSFileSystem annotation and cvscore.cmdline formatting
</ul>

<p>
Documenatation and tests are missing...
