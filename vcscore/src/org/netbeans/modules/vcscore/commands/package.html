Commands scheduling and executing framework implementation.

<h2>Command Processing Engine</h2>

Package keeps trace of all running commands and schedules
and dispatches queued commands to performing threads.

<p>
Main package entry point is CommandProcessor.process() method
that is called from CommandTask.run() that is called by ...
(XXX there is mess, I cannot understand CommandTask.run() vs.
CommandTask.execute() called by runCommandTask from an Info).
<p>
It looks like it's {@link org.netbeans.api.vcs.commnds API} implementation
so real client entry point is the API.

<h2>UI</h2>
{@link org.netbeans.modules.vcscore.runtime} contains engine UI implementation.
