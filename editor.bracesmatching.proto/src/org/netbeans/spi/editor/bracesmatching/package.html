  <p>
  The Braces Matching SPI is for registering services capable of finding matching
  areas of text in a document.
  </p>

  
  <h3>Key parts of the SPI</h3>
  
  <p>
  The main part of the SPI is the
  <code><a href="@org-netbeans-modules-editor-bracesmatching@/org/netbeans/spi/editor/bracesmatching/BracesMatcher.html">BracesMatcher</a></code>
  interface, which
  needs to be implemented by anybody who wishes to provide a text matching
  services for a particular type of documents. Implementations of the
  <code>BracesMatcher</code> interface can be plugged in to the system by
  registering 
  <code><a href="@org-netbeans-modules-editor-bracesmatching@/org/netbeans/spi/editor/bracesmatching/BracesMatcherFactory.html">BracesMatcherFactory</a></code> 
  in the MIME lookup.
  </p>
  
  <p>The editor
  infrastructure will use registered factories to create matchers for highlighting
  matching areas in documents. Each type of a document (ie. mime type or more
  precisely each mime path) can have at most one <code>BracesMatcher</code> registered.
  If there is more different implementations registered for the same mime path
  the infrastructure will only use the first one.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  When asking a <code>BracesMatcherFactory</code> to create an instance of
  <code>BracesMatcher</code> the infrastructure passes the factory an instance of
  <code><a href="@org-netbeans-modules-editor-bracesmatching@/org/netbeans/spi/editor/bracesmatching/MatcherContext.html">MatcherContext</a></code>, 
  which provides an information about a document
  and a position in that document, where the matching should start. The provided
  <code>MatcherContext</code> can also be used to report the matching areas back
  to the infrastructure.
  </p>

  
  <h3>BracesMatcher registration</h3>
  
  <p>
  The registration of <code>BracesMatcher</code>s has to be done through an
  instance of the <code>BracesMatcherFactory</code> class. The factory should
  be registered in <code>MimeLookup</code> under the mime-type of documents, which
  the <code>BracesMatcher</code> should be used for. For example, if a module
  wants to provide <code>BracesMatcher</code> for <code>text/x-something</code> documents
  it should implement its own <code>BracesMatcherFactory</code> (e.g.
  <code>org.some.module.BMFactory</code> class) and register it in <code>MimeLookup</code>
  using its XML layer as it is shown on the example below.
  </p>
  
  <pre>
&lt;folder name="Editors"&gt;
  &lt;folder name="text"&gt;
    &lt;folder name="x-something"&gt;
        &lt;file name="org-some-module-BMFactory.instance" /&gt;
    &lt;/folder&gt;
  &lt;/folder&gt;
&lt;/folder&gt;
  </pre>

  <p>
  The <code>BMFactory</code> class will simply return a new instance of
  the module's implementation of the <code>BracesMatcher</code> interface from its
  <code>createMatcher</code>
  method. The parameter of the <code>createMatcher</code> method provides access to
  a <code>Document</code> and a position of a caret in this document, where
  searching should start.
  </p>

  
  <h3>Languages embedding</h3>
  
  <p>
  The registration mechanism described earlier and the general concept of MIME lookup
  allows to provide special <code>BracesMatcher</code>s for embedded languages.
  The editor infrastructure will always try to find the inner-most language at
  a position in a document, where the matching should start. It will then create
  the <code>BracesMatcher</code> according to the mime path of that inner-most
  language.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  As per the general inheritance rules defined by MIME lookup this may result
  in using a <code>BracesMatcher</code> that is registered for a top level
  language (ie. mime type) different from the main language of the scanned
  document. Here is an example of a java snippet in a JSP page, the caret's
  position is indicated by the '|' pipe character. Assuming that there are only
  two <code>BracesMatcher</code> implementations registered - one for <code>text/x-jsp</code>
  and the other one for <code>text/x-java</code>, the infrastructure's attempt to find a matcher
  for the <code>text/x-jsp/text/x-java</code> mime path is going to result in
  finding the matcher registered for <code>text/x-java</code>.
  </p>
  
  <pre>
&lt;% for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) <span style="background-color : pink;">{</span> %&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;%=i%&gt;. column&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;% <span style="background-color : pink;">}</span>| %&gt;
  </pre>
  
  <p>
  Since the support for languages embedding comes with the new Lexer API, the
  above example is naturally only going to work for document types that provide
  a <code>Lexer</code> implementation. This is the case for the most document types
  supported in Netbeans 6. In case that a document does not have a <code>Lexer</code>
  the infrastructure will fall back to using the document's mime type ignoring
  any other languages that may potentially be embedded in the document.
  </p>
  
  
  <h3><a name="usecases">Use cases</a></h3>

  <p>
  Although the SPI can generally by used for highlighting areas in a document
  that have something in common, the usecases below are demonstrated on a simple
  braces matching example. This example is used for its simplicity and clarity,
  but it could be substituted by any other more complex example.
  </p>

  <p>
  The usecases listed here were heavily inspired by comments in issues
  <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=95126">95126</a> and
  <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=66037">66037</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  The terminology used here refers to two key terms - an <b>original brace</b> (area)
  and a <b>matching brace</b> (area or areas). Understanding those two terms is essential.
  The original brace is the brace that lies in the near vicinity of a caret and
  it defines the place where searching for the matching brace will start. If there
  is no original brace, there also is no matching brace to search for. While there
  is always only at most one original area (brace), there can generally be none,
  one or more matching areas.
  </p>
  
  
  <h4>Use case 1. - Directional searching</h4>

  <p>
  The search for matching braces in a text document always starts at a position
  of a caret by looking 'around' this position for a brace that we could then
  try to match against its counterpart. This 'looking around' in fact means
  looking backward from the caret's position, looking ahead of it or looking
  in both directions.
  </p>

  <p>
  When looking only in one direction - either backward or forward - the situation
  is simple, either we find a brace or not. If there is a brace it can be used
  as the original brace and we can attemp to find the matching brace. If
  there is no original brace, then we are done.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  When looking in both directions the situation is slightly more complicated
  and we can end up with one of the following possibilities.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
      <li>No brace in either direction</li>
      <li>A brace in backward direction</li>
      <li>A brace in forward direction</li>
      <li>Braces in both directions</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
  The search direction can be controlled by a special client property on per-component
  basis. The property is called <code>nbeditor-bracesMatching-allowedSearchDirection</code>
  and its allowed values are <code>backward</code> and <code>forward</code>. By default
  when the property is not specified the infrastructure searches in both directions.
  </p>
  
  
  <h4>Use case 2. - Proximity searching</h4>

  <p>
  In generall, there can be situations when it makes sense to look for an original brace
  not only right next to a caret, but also <i>"a little bit further"</i>. The scope
  of this search should however always be very limeted and the results should only 
  be used when they are unambigous. The following example demonstrates the rules
  applied by the infrastructure.
  </p>
  
  <pre>
1.    if (...) { // explain the if clause
2.        ...
3.    } else { // explain the else clause
4.        ...
5.    } // final comment
  </pre>

  <ul>
  <li>
      The search for an original brace should never leave the scope of the line with a caret.
  </li>
  <li>
      If an original brace is found only in one direction it can be used even
      if it is not located right next to a caret. For example, if the caret is
      at the end of the 3. line, there is only one original brace and it is the
      one that is opening the 'else' block.
  </li>
  <li>
      If an original brace is found in both directions, only the one that lies
      right next to a caret can be used. If none of them lies next to a caret,
      none of them will be used. For example, if the caret is positioned in the
      'else' keyword, there are two original braces one in each direaction, but
      none of them lies next to a caret and therefore none of them will be used.
  </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
  The maximum distance, measured in characters from the position of a caret, that
  the proximity search should be attempted in can be controlled by a special
  property called <code>nbeditor-bracesMatching-maxLookahead</code> on per-component
  basis. The allowed values for this property are small positive integers. If
  the property is not defined the default lookahead is to the beginning or
  end of a line with the caret. The absolute maximum enforced by the infrastructure
  is 256 characters.
  </p>


  <h4>Use case 3. - Highlighting results</h4>
  
  <p>
  Probably the main reason why this SPI exists is to allow Netbeans editor to
  highlight matching braces in a document. The highlighting itself is done by the
  infrastructure and is not of a concern for <code>BracesMatcher</code> implementors,
  but the requirements are that it should be possible to highlight independently
  (ie. in a different color) both the original brace and the matching brace. It should also
  be possible to highlight the original brace in a special color when its matching
  brace can't be found. The colors obviously have to be customizable by users.
  </p>
  
  
  <h4>Use case 4. - Navigating between results</h4>
  
  <p>
  If the original brace is detected and its matching brace is found Netbeans editor
  needs to allow an easy navigation between those two position (ie. jumping
  from the original brace to the matching one and back.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  In general if there is more than one matching area users should be allowed to cycle
  through all of them.
  </p>


  <h4>Use case 5. - Time consuming searches</h4>

  <p>
  While finding the original brace is relatively simle task, because it's always
  done in a limited and quite small area around a caret, finding the matching
  brace can take much more time and in generall it can involve searching through
  a whole document. The searching is normally done in response to moving a caret
  in a document, which means that there can be a lot of search requests generated
  when a user moves the caret quickly over some text. It is not very important
  to show all the results as the caret moves, but it is important to show the
  last result when the caret stops moving.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The editor infrastructure must make sure that moving a caret is not impacted by
  performing searches for matching areas. These searches have to run on background,
  outside of the Swing's event thread and most importantly it has to be possible
  to cancel searches, whose results are no longer needed.
