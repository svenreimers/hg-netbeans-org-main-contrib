Scattered notes from Mark Roth on what remains to be done in this module.

feature freeze: dec 8, 2004
another feature freeze for 4.1 in 3rd week of jan
branch for ea 2 won't be done before jan 5

[ ] Refactor:
    [ ] Each tab should be its own class, that provides
        getScrollPosition() and setScrollPosition() instead of the if/else
[ ] Script for our workspace
    [x] Clicking links leads to crashes - remove <a> links
    [x] Fix spacing problems in HTML
    [ ] ws-context directory
    [ ] Cases where WAR name does not equal directory name, like 
        clientside-validators
    [ ] Check that it works with non-webapps
        [ ] add code for JMS resource, EJB resource, etc.
    [ ] Handle solutions that contain no examples, e.g. standalone-client
    [ ] Shorter names in "New Project" dialog
    [ ] Script to check that there's src/java and give a warning if there isn't.
        [ ] File bug on NetBeans that src/java must exist.

[x] Implement back and forward buttons
[ ] Printable page - Use print cookie that enables print action in NBs? This 
    is the NB way.
[ ] Sort articles alphabetically

[ ] deploy and test all included apps on 4.1
[ ] want at least one example with an EJB
[ ] Install Example button is a bit misleading.  Rename to something like
    "New Project From This Template".

Later:
[ ] Bookmarks
[ ] I18N "bpsample-" prefix
[ ] Discussion/Q&A: add a button to button panel to discuss this example. 
    Can we make this discussion button Should we have this discussion in NB 
    community or on java.net?
[ ] If each time user clicks on an entry they get this dialog box, it could 
    be frustrating.  Can we jump to the already open project?
