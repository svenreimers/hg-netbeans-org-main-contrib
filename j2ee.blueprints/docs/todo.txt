Scattered notes from Mark Roth on what remains to be done in this module.

[ ] Finish converting module to read new bpcatalog.xml instead of demo.xml
    [ ] DOCTYPE was removed from bpcatalog.xml.  See if I can get 
        it working after adding it back in.
[ ] About / Info tab that shows usingTxt and usingTxt1 from bundle.properties
    Also points to web site, etc.
[ ] deploy and test all included apps on 4.1
    [.] clientside-state is not picking up base64.lib even if I move 
        it to WEB-INF/lib 
        (disabled this example for now)
    [ ] non-web apps
[.] Fix Lukas' bug list
    [.] /docoriented
        - i can't run this example due to errors when opening project:
          - cannot find Web Pages folder "<some_path>". Set "web.docbase.dir" property in project.properties file to point to correct folder.
          - description of next exception is really interesting: "A java.lang.NullPointerException exception has occurred. However, the system should continue working without further problems. Click Details for the stack trace."
        (disabled for now)
    [.] /clientside-state
        - additional library (base64) is not automatically on the classpath
        - the rest of this app is OK.
        Greg stated that app bundles base64 jars into the Web-INF/lib of that war file, which is portable solution and should be supported by NB, so no changes needed to application example code.
        STATUS: seems like an NB problem or integration problem? 
        (disabled for now)
[ ] Script for our workspace
    [ ] Cases where WAR name does not equal directory name, like 
        clientside-validators
    [ ] Check that it works with non-webapps
        [ ] add code for JMS resource, EJB resource, etc.
    [ ] Handle solutions that contain no examples, e.g. standalone-client
    [ ] ws-context directory
[ ] want at least one example with an EJB
[ ] Printable page - Use print cookie that enables print action in NBs? This 
    is the NB way.
[ ] Sort articles alphabetically
[ ] Install Example button is a bit misleading.  Rename to something like
    "New Project From This Template".

Later:
[ ] Bookmarks
[ ] I18N "bpsample-" prefix
[ ] Discussion/Q&A: add a button to button panel to discuss this example. 
    Can we make this discussion button Should we have this discussion in NB 
    community or on java.net?
[ ] If each time user clicks on an entry they get this dialog box, it could 
    be frustrating.  Can we jump to the already open project?
