Scattered notes from Mark Roth on what remains to be done in this module.

feature freeze: dec 8, 2004
another feature freeze for 4.1 in 3rd week of jan
branch for ea 2 won't be done before jan 5

[ ] deploy and test all included apps on 4.1
    [ ] clientside-state is not picking up base64.lib even if I move 
        it to WEB-INF/lib
    [ ] non-web apps
[ ] Fix Lukas' bug list
    [ ] /docoriented
        - i can't run this example due to errors when opening project:
          - cannot find Web Pages folder "<some_path>". Set "web.docbase.dir" property in project.properties file to point to correct folder.
          - description of next exception is really interesting: "A java.lang.NullPointerException exception has occurred. However, the system should continue working without further problems. Click Details for the stack trace."
    [ ] /clientside-state
        - additional library (base64) is not automatically on the classpath
        - the rest of this app is OK.
        Greg stated that app bundles base64 jars into the Web-INF/lib of that war file, which is portable solution and should be supported by NB, so no changes needed to application example code.
        STATUS: seems like an NB problem or integration problem? 
[ ] Script for our workspace
    [ ] Cases where WAR name does not equal directory name, like 
        clientside-validators
    [ ] Check that it works with non-webapps
        [ ] add code for JMS resource, EJB resource, etc.
    [ ] Handle solutions that contain no examples, e.g. standalone-client
    [ ] Shorter names in "New Project" dialog
    [ ] Script to check that there's src/java and give a warning if there isn't.
        [ ] File bug on NetBeans that src/java must exist.
    [ ] ws-context directory
[ ] want at least one example with an EJB
[ ] Printable page - Use print cookie that enables print action in NBs? This 
    is the NB way.
[ ] Sort articles alphabetically
[ ] Install Example button is a bit misleading.  Rename to something like
    "New Project From This Template".
[ ] About box that shows usingTxt and usingTxt1 from bundle.properties

Later:
[ ] Bookmarks
[ ] I18N "bpsample-" prefix
[ ] Discussion/Q&A: add a button to button panel to discuss this example. 
    Can we make this discussion button Should we have this discussion in NB 
    community or on java.net?
[ ] If each time user clicks on an entry they get this dialog box, it could 
    be frustrating.  Can we jump to the already open project?
