[ ] Finish converting module to read new bpcatalog.xml instead of demo.xml
   [ ] DOCTYPE was removed from bpcatalog.xml.  See if I can get
       it working after adding it back in.

[.] /clientside-state application
       - additional library (base64) is not automatically on the classpath
       - the rest of this app is OK.
       Greg stated that app bundles base64 jars into the Web-INF/lib of that war file, which is portable solution and should be supported by NB, so no changes needed to application example code.
       STATUS: seems like an NB problem or integration problem?
       (disabled for now)
[ ] Script for our workspace
   [ ] Cases where WAR name does not equal directory name, like
       clientside-validators
   [ ] Check that it works with non-webapps
       [ ] add code for JMS resource, EJB resource, etc.
   [ ] Handle solutions that contain no examples, e.g. standalone-client
[ ] Bookmarks
[ ] If each time user clicks on an entry they get this dialog box, it could
   be frustrating.  Can we jump to the already open project?
