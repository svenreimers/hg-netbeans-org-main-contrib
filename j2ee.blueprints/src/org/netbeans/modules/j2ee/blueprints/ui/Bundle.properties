NB_title=Java BluePrints Solutions Catalog
#These are not used yet, but would make good text for an About dialog
#so don't remove them.
usingTxt=This is an early access version of the Java BluePrints Solutions Catalog.\n\
Each entry in the catalog is presented in a problem-solution format that discusses the key issues in the problem topic and provides various strategies, patterns, and design guidelines for the solution.\
The catalog is also available as a Web application that provides enhanced the capabilities to browse the source code, and run the associated sample applications.\
The web applications are downloadable from http://bpcatalog.dev.java.net.\n\n\
There are currently three categories as follows. Click the title of each category to see the solutions.
usingTxt1=Note that this is a preview build and the functionality it contains is still \
under development. It may therefore contain bugs that can lead to data loss and should not be used for working on production sources. \
The Early Access release automatically uses a separate user directory than your current NetBeans IDE user directory. \
You should also not open any NetBeans IDE 4.0 projects in the Early Access build. Doing so will cause the project to not work properly in NetBeans IDE 4.0.\n\
