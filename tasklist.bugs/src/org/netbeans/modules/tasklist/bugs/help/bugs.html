<h2> Bug List View </h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://tasklist.netbeans.org"><b>buglist</b></a> module
connects to a bug database and lists the bugs in a tasklist format. <br>
</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: The bug list module is in alpha stage. It's missing a
query GUI. It can easily be integrated with any bug
tracking data bases; please write to dev@tasklist.netbeans.org if
you're interested in writing a bridge to some bug tracking
system.
</p>
<p>To show the bug list window, click this icon in the
tasklist toolbar: <img src="bugsView.gif">
</p>
<p>The Bug List module allows you to view your bug list. The bug list
is fetched from a bug database server when you open the bug window,
or when you select the "Refresh" action in its context menu.
</p>
<p>You can double click on a bug to view its details; for Issuezilla
that means opening a browser window showing the detailed bug view.
</p>
<p>You can not modify any values in the bug list; the bug list is
"read only". However, one developer has talked about using the
writable HTTP filesystem to support direct updates so this may be a
feature available in the future.
</p>
<p>You can customize which task properties are shown in the list,
change the sorting order, etc. See the <a href="table-operation.html">Using
the Table</a> document
for details on how to do that.
