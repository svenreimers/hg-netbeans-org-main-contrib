        <h2>Debugging Python Applications</h2>
        <p>Debugging is the process of examining your application for errors.
            The process of debugging is accomplished by setting breakpoints and
            watches in your code and running it in the debugger.
            This enables you to execute your code one line at a time and examine
        the state of your application in order to discover any problems.</p>

        <h3>Setting Up Python Projects for Debugging</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Check Debugger options: Go to Tools > Options > Python and
            click on the Debugger tab :</li>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Debugger listening starting port:</b> For better
                    isolation when debugging, the debugger is automatically started in a separate
                    process and communicates with the IDE over an IP socket.
                    This field specifies the port number where the debugger process
                is listening for incoming Python debugging solicitations. </li>
                <li><b>Debugging shell colors and fonts:</b>This group of buttons customizes
                the debugging shell colors.</li>
                <li><b>Stop at first line: </b> When checked, the debugger will stop at the
                    first line of the debugger script. When unchecked the debugger will stop at
                the first breakpoint found in the script.</li>
            </ul>
           <li><b>Setting the breakpoints:</b> In the Source Editor, click in the left
            margin next to the desired line of code where you want to set a breakpoint.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Starting the Debugger</h3>
        <p>After the breakpoints have been set, click on Debug and select the appropriate option to start the debugging session.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If there is more than one project open, <b>Ctrl + F5</b> will start the debugging session on the main project.</li>
            <li>To start a debugging session on a particular Python file, select the file and type <tt>Ctrl + Shift + F5</tt>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Debugger Windows</h3>
        <p>In addition to the Default Shell window, there are windows which display
        other runtime configurations of the application currently being debugged:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Call Stack Window</b></li>
            <li><b>Local Variables Window</b></li>
            <li><b>Threads Window</b></li>
        </ul>
