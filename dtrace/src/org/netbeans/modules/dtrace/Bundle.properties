OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=The NetBeans DTrace GUI plug-in is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Solaris Dynamic Tracing (DTrace) that can be installed into the Sun Studio IDE, NetBeans IDE 6.1, NetBeans IDE 6.5, and NetBeans IDE 6.7. You can run D scripts from the GUI, even those that are embedded in shell scripts.</p><p>You can visualize the output of DTrace using Chime. Chime is a graphical tool for visualizing DTrace aggregations. Chime is fully integrated with NetBeans DTrace GUI Plug-in.</p><p>The NetBeans DTrace GUI plug-in is architected in such a way that you can easily extend and customize it.</p><p>The GUI package consists of two components: The NetBeans plug-in (includes Chime) and the <tt>DTraceScripts</tt> directory. The <tt>DTraceScripts</tt> directory contains several subdirectories. Each subdirectory contains several D scripts categorized mostly based on DTrace providers. Chime displays are included in the DTraceScripts directory. </p><p>For instructions on running the DTrace GUI plug-in click the <a href="http://dtrace.netbeans.org"> Home Page</a> <p>NetBeans Dynamic Tracing (DTrace) software includes third-party technologies governed by the third-party license readme at http://www.netbeans.org/kb/docs/ide/THIRDPARTYLICENSEREADE.html.</p>
