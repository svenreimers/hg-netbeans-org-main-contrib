        <h1>Key Bindings Explorer Module</h1>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        Key Bindings Explorer is a simple module that lets you explore
        all the currently defined key bindings. Invoking the actions shows the Key
        Binding Dialog showing the current key bindings in a tablular form.
        <ul>
            <li>Show Key Bindings (Alt+U K)<br>
            <img src="keybinding.jpg" alt="Key Bindings"/>
            <li>Show Action Bindings (Alt+U A)<br>
            <img src="actionsbinding.jpg" alt="Action Bindings"/>
        </ul>        
        In each row of the table it shows details of the key binding.
        <ul>
            <li>The first column shows the key sequence that invokes the action. 
            <li>The second column shows the key sequence (without the modifiers) that
            invokes the action. 
            <li>The third column shows the invoked action. 
            <li>The fourth column shows the context in which the key sequence is
            applicable. A blank context means global context. Other contexts indicate 
            the type of editor.             
        </ul>
        On top of the first, second and third column there are text fields which let you
        quickly search for an entry in respective columns. In the text fields above
        the first and second column simply type the key sequence (e.g. Alt+U) to
        initiate the search.     
        <p>
        The table columns can be sorted (ascending and descending) by clicking on the headers.
        Use control click to do add secondary and tertiary sort columns.
        <p>
        You can also save the current view as Html/Xml by clicking on the Output
        to Html/Xml actions.
        <p>

        <ul>
            <li>Show non bound actions.
            <li>Support modification of key bindings.
