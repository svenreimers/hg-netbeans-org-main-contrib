        A simple project that exposes all of the HTML and related files under the project 
        directory.  Directories named <code>www</code> or <code>public-html</code> are
        automatically openable as HTML projects; to open other directories as HTML
        projects, use New | HTML Project (no metadata is saved, so the project will not
        write or change any files underneath the directory - the system will just remember
        that you marked this directory as an HTML Project by creating one there).
