<h1>Metrics Definitions</h1>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The metrics module currently supports the following metrics:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>WMC</b>, or <b>Weighted Methods in a Class</b>, is defined as the sum of the complexities
 of all methods in a class.  The problem is that no one agrees on the definition 
 of a method's complexity, so many metrics tools just punt and assign one 
(1) to each method.  In this module I use a variant on McCabe's Cyclomatic 
Complexity metric, so that methods with more code paths are weighted more 
heavily.  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>A high WMC metric value may indicate unnecessary complexity, such as 
 a "hairball" class design or a complex method which could use refactoring. 
  It can also indicate a procedural design hiding in an object-oriented 
wrapper.  </p>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
<li><b>CBO</b>, or <b>Coupling Between Objects</b>, is defined as the sum of the
  classes referenced by a class and the number of classes which reference
a class.  Good object-oriented design recommends that classes be as lightly-
 coupled as possible, so high CBO metrics may indicate poor design.  A class
 which is tightly coupled with other classes is also more sensitive to changes
 in those classes, increasing the risk of regressions.   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
<li><b>RFC</b>, or <b>Response For Class</b>, is defined as the sum of all external
 methods called by a class, plus all methods those  methods call.  A class
 with a high RFC is also more sensitive to regressions.  It can also be more
 expensive to maintain, because more knowledge of the called libraries is
needed to do effective maintenance.  An example of this is to compare a javax.swing
 method call and a java.util call:  because  Swing is a much more complex
API, it can take longer to make a correct change to its client code than
a java.util class.   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
<li><b>MPC</b>, or <b>Message Passing Coupling</b>, is defined as the sum of the number
 of method calls made by all methods in a class.  Like RFC and CBO, MPC is
 a measure of a class' complexity.  Classes with high MPC metrics may be
doing  too much work, and should  be split into smaller, more narrowly focused 
classes.    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><b>DIT</b>, or <b>Depth of Inheritance Tree</b>, is equal to the number of superclasses 
 of a class.  Classes with lots of superclasses have their behavior scattered 
 in lots of places, requiring more effort to maintain them.  This is the hidden
 cost of  subclassing, often overlooked in OO designs.   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><b>NOC</b>, or <b>Number Of Children</b>, is the number of child classes. Classes
 with lots of child classes need to be very carefully modified to avoid regressions 
 in those children.   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><b>NT</b>, or <b>Number of Tramps</b>, is the number of parameters in a class'
methods which are not referenced by its code.  While there may be valid reasons
for unreferenced parameters (such as a default implementation in an abstract 
 base class), in general they can add unnecessary complexity both for clients 
 and sustaining engineers.  Worse, their lack of use may indicate a potential 
 bug.   Methods which don't reference any instance variables may be better 
 implemented as static methods, as this may improve performance on many VMs.</li>
  </ul>
