  <title>NetBeans Metrics Module</title>

<h1>NetBeans Metrics Module</h1>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The NetBeans Metrics module is a plug-in for NetBeans
which adds object-oriented metrics capabilities.  Once installed, a developer
may view metrics on a per-class or project basis, and be able to "drill
down"  to find out how the metric was calculated.  Unlike traditional metrics
tools which provide sophisticated reporting of lots of different metrics,
the metrics module instead focuses on bringing a small number of metrics
into the developer's edit/compile loop.</p>
<p>Metrics are not indications of bugs or poor design, but high metric numbers
  often indicate how complex, fragile, or sensitive to  regressions a class
  may be.  Classes or methods with high metric values may be good candidates 
 for <a href="http://refactoring.netbeans.org">refactoring</a>.  It is therefore useful for a developer to monitor project metrics 
and investigate those metrics which seem out of line.</p>
<p>Like a car's dashboard warning lights, the metrics module flags classes 
 and methods which cross various metric thresholds with a yellow (warning) 
 or red (error) light next to their icons in the Explorer.  A developer 
has the choice of refactoring the class or method, or approving the current
 metric value; in either case, the warning light goes out.  The metrics 
module is therefore useful as a guide during class creation and maintenance
 to encourage the development of lighter weight classes which are loosely
coupled.</p>
