     * it indicates whether the metric is valid for a single class.
     * <p>
     * For example, the NOC metric (Number Of
     * Children) requires that all other classes which possibly
     * subclass from this class must first be scanned, so the NOC
     * metric would return <b>true</b> for this method.  A metric
     * such as RFC (Response For Class) references other classes,
     * but does so bytaking its list of dependencies and
     * scanning those classes as well.  It would therefore return
     * <b>false</b>.
     *
     * Only metrics which return <b>false</b> to this method are
     * displayed in a class' metrics properties page.  Metrics
     * which only make sense in context with other classes are
     * shown in the table created by the "Metrics..." tools command.
