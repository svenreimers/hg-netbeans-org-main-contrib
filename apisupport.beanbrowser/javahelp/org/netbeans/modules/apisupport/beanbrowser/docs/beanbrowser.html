<h2>NetBeans Runtime Inspector</h2>

<p>The NetBeans Runtime Inspector facility lets you look at the structure of objects
live in the IDE, provided they can be represented as JavaBeans (which
many API-related objects can). To use the inspector,
Flip to the <b>Runtime</b> tab in the Explorer and look under the
<b>NetBeans Runtime</b> node - you will see some important folders in the system filesystem.
You will also see the <a href="beanbrowser-lookup.html">lookup helper</a>.

<p>In the inspector, by default nodes just show up as themselves, but they
will show extra children. First of all, their regular children are displayed in
a special subnode, to separate them from other things. Other subnodes may be
displayed, including:

<ul>

<li>A list of all properties of the node, broken up by property set. These display
as object nodes, which means they can in turn show hierarchy for e.g. Java
collections or arrays, etc. Properties which are themselves beans will show up
as bean nodes, i.e. their default representation.

<li>A list of all computed properties of the node (if it represents a Bean with an
instance), under <b>Raw&nbsp;bean&nbsp;properties</b>. Here, <code>BeanInfo</code>
is simply ignored, and all getter methods are treated as fair game--even if they
are not public methods. Useful for classes which have <code>BeanInfo</code> which
does not include all the information you might to debug with.

<li>Any node with an <code>InstanceCookie</code> will show that instance as a Bean.

<li><code>Node</code> properties will appear as themselves, after an introduction.

<li><code>Container</code> properties (i.e. visual beans) will show the AWT
component hierarchy.

<li><code>FileSystem</code> properties additionally display the root folder.
This lets you browse to a specific file in the filesystem.

<li><code>FileObject</code> properties additionally display the data object
(from which you can also see the node delegate). And you get a list of file
attributes by name.
File objects which are part of a <code>MultiFileSystem</code> will show the
original filesystem which produced them. In the case of file objects in the
system filesystem, you can see the <em>provenance</em> of the file, indicating
whether it was defined in a module (including the core - generally some XML
layer); the user directory (global setting); the installation directory (rarer);
or the current project.

<li><code>Clipboard</code> objects show the objects associated
with each currently supported data flavor in their
transferables. Go to <code>java.awt.Clipboard</code> under <b>Lookup&nbsp;results</b> for
example. Also <code>ExClipboard</code> objects will update this
information when it changes, and <code>MultiTransferObject</code>
objects are broken apart into constituent flavors.

<li>Instances of <code>Lookup.Provider</code> method (such as nodes, data objects, and so on)
will be examined for a list of all standard cookie types, and these cookies will be shown
in a separate sublist for examination.
<a href="beanbrowser-lookup.html">(Details...)</a>
It is possible to recognize your own cookie types, too;
if your module defines a cookie you wish to see listed, simply add an XML file to its layer
underneath <samp>Services/Hidden/</samp> matching the DTD at
<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/dtds/apisupport-cookie-class-list-1_0.dtd"><samp>http://www.netbeans.org/dtds/apisupport-cookie-class-list-1_0.dtd</samp></a>.

<li>When browsing objects representing <code>FilterNode</code>s, you can see
the original node.

</ul>
