<title>API Support Module - Bean Browser and Lookup</title>

<h2>Bean Browser - Lookup Helper</h2>

<p>Under <b>Runtime&nbsp;| Bean&nbsp;Browser&nbsp;| Lookup&nbsp;results</b>
you can find out what is currently in the lookup system. Right click on this
node and select <b>Add&nbsp;Superclass/interface</b>. You will be asked for a
class name. Type in the fully qualified name of any class in the APIs or modules,
for example <samp>org.openide.filesystems.MIMEResolver</samp> or
<samp>org.openide.awt.HtmlBrowser$Factory</samp>.

<p>Now browse underneath the lookup node and you will see all instances of that class
registered in the system's default lookup. Each instance can be explored using the
Bean Browser. Also the tooltip for an instance gives you the lookup item ID
(for example, the name of the data object with which an instance was registered).
If the contents of lookup change (e.g. because of module installation), the result
node will be refreshed.

<p>As instances become available, queries for their class (and superclasses and
implemented interfaces) are added for you automatically.

<p>To help you understand how the property editor for <code>java.lang.Object</code>
works that is part of the UI of services, the lookup node also has a property
using this property editor restricted to the class you are looking up. Its pulldown
shows the user-oriented displays of the available instances, and its custom property
editor permits you to select one from a tree view of services.
