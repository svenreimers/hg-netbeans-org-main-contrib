<h2>NetBeans Runtime Inspector - Lookup Helper</h2>

<p>Under <b>Runtime&nbsp;| NetBeans&nbsp;Runtime&nbsp;| Global Lookup</b>
you can find out what is currently in the lookup system: <code>Lookup.getDefault()</code>. If you see something
missing you think should be there, right click on this
node and select <b>Add&nbsp;Superclass/interface</b>. You will be asked for a
class name. Type in the fully qualified name of any class in the APIs or modules,
for example <samp>org.openide.filesystems.MIMEResolver</samp> or
<samp>org.openide.awt.HtmlBrowser$Factory</samp>.

<p>Now browse underneath the lookup node and you will see all instances of that class
registered in the system's default lookup, organized in an inheritance tree.
Each instance can be explored using the
inspector. Also the tooltip for an instance gives you the lookup item ID
(for example, the name of the data object with which an instance was registered).
If the contents of lookup change (e.g. because of module installation), the result
node will be refreshed.

<p>As instances become available, queries for their class (and superclasses and
implemented interfaces) are added for you automatically.

<p>You can also look under <b>Action Lookup</b> to see the contents of
<code>Utilities.actionsGlobalContext()</code>, which is the context used
by globally-installed context-sensitive actions (e.g. <code>CookieNode</code>s).
Normally this lookup will be based on the selected nodes of the active
<code>TopComponent</code>.
