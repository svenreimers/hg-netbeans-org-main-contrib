<h2>NetBeans Runtime Inspector Demo</h2>

<p>Here is an example of what you can do with the inspector:

<OL>

<LI>Go to <b>Runtime&nbsp;| NetBeans&nbsp;Runtime</b>.
Maximize the window to make sure there is enough
room to see many nodes. Open a Property Sheet if there is not
yet one open.

<LI><b>Lookup&nbsp;results</b> -&gt; <b>org.openide.windows.WindowManager</b>.

<LI><b>org.netbeans.core.windows.WindowManagerImpl</b> -&gt; <b>Properties</b>.

<LI><b>mainWindow</b> -&gt; <b>Components</b>.

<LI><i>(only child)</i> -&gt; <b>Components</b>.

<LI><b>null.layeredPane</b> -&gt; <b>Components</b>.

<LI><i>(MenuBar)</i> -&gt; <b>Components</b>.

<LI>First child: property <b>text</b> in Property Sheet should read <code>File</code>.

<LI>Change property to <code>Phile</code>. IDE menu bar should change.

</OL>

<p>Remember to look at tool tips on the nodes, and have fun browsing the IDE!
