This module provides integration with the PMD module for NetBeans,
available from pmd.sf.net.

You'll need to have that module installed before you can build
this bridge module.

If it's installed in the IDE's module directory, ant should be
able to find it and the build will work. 

Otherwise, create a file named "build.properties" in this directory
containing for example

pmdmod=/tmp/cvs/pmd-netbeans/build/pmd.jar
pmdlib=/tmp/cvs/pmd-netbeans/lib/pmd-1.01.jar

Here, ${pmdmod} is the PMD module jar file built by the
PMD NetBeans module, and ${pmdlib} is the PMD library jar
itself (used by many IDE plugins.)
