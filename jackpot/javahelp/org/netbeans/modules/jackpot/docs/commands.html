        <h2>Jackpot Commands</h2>

        </p> 
        <p>
            Jackpot has two types of commands (actions):  queries and
            transformations.  A query is a command which searches for 
            patterns in code and reports any matches.  A transformation
            extends a query to modify any found matches.
        </p>
        <p><b>NOTE:</b> the Early Access releases of Jackpot provide query
            and transformer demonstrations, to demonstrate the Jackpot rule language
            and API.  More useful commands will be included when Jackpot releases.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Jackpot module is distributed with the following query
            commands:
            <ul>
                <li>Bad finally Blocks:  locates try blocks with finally 
                    clauses which contain throws or return statements.</li>
                <li>Constructors Calling Public Methods:  scans for constructors
                    which invoke public methods which can be overridden.  This is
                    considered an error because the object may be only partially
                    initialized when referenced by a subclass.</li>
                <li>Find Unused Variables:  finds variables which are not 
                    referenced by any source files within the queried project(s).</li>
                <li>Statistics: a simple counter of classes, methods, fields, 
                    statements, and AST nodes.</li>
                <li>Find EJB Classes: reports which classes implement EJB
                    interfaces.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Jackpot module is distributed with the following transformation
            commands:
            <ul>
                <li>Add Conditionals: replaces simple if/then/else statements 
                    with conditional expression statements.</li>
                <li>Add Deprecated Annotations: adds "@Deprecated" annotations 
                    to methods and fields which are deprecated (unless their 
                    class is deprecated).</li>
                <li>Add Override Annotations: adds an "@Override" annotation to 
                    each method which overrides a superclass method.  The 
                    <b>javac</b> compiler will then verify that contract with
                    each build.</li>
                <li>Change Copyright: replaces the copyright comment at the top 
                    of Java source files.
                <li>Cleanup: removes common code redundancy, simplifying the 
                    source without changing its functionality.</li>
                <li>Convert SwingUtilities Methods: changes references to the 
                    SwingUtilities methods that were moved to the EventQueue in 
                    Java 1.3.</li>
                <li>Minimize Field Access and Minimize Method Access: 
                    restricts field and method access as much as possible given their
                    current usage by other classes.</li>
                <li>Remove Conditionals: replaces conditional expression 
                    statements with equivalent if/then/else statements.</li>
                <li>Remove Unnecessary Casts: eliminates cast expressions when
                    the expression being cast is already that type.</li>
                <li>Simplify Boolean Expressions: converts complex boolean 
                    expressions into their simpler equivalents, without 
                    changing the expression's logic.</li>
                <li>Simplify Loops: finds unnecessarily complicated code in 
                    loops, if statements and blocks and simplifies it without 
                    changing its semantics.</li>
                <li>StringTokenizer To Scanner: converts StringTokenizer 
                    references to use Java 5's Scanner class.</li>
                <li>Tail Merge: finds common statements at the end (tail) of an
                    if statement's then and else clauses, then pulls the common
                    statements out so they follow the if statement.</li>
            </ul>
