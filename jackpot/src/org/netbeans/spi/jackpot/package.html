    <title>Jackpot SPI</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      This package defines the SPI used by modules which add support for 
      languages, such as the Jackpot Rules language and JavaScript.  To add
      the ability to define Jackpot queries and transformers in these
      languages, their modules define a QueryProvider implementation which 
      returns a Query instance for the script.  This package also defines 
      the exceptions which may be thrown during execution of the returned Query.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Note:</em> this SPI does not allow Jackpot to be extended to 
        support other languages.  Jackpot is designed to work specifically with 
        Java language sources through its use of the <code>javac</code> compiler
        API.  Jackpot queries and transformers are only executed on Java source 
        files, regardless of what language the query or transformer is itself
        written in.
