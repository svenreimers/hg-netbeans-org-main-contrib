ConfigureDetectorsDialog.explanation.text=<html>\
    <p>When automatic project detection is enabled, any folder which contains a <code>build.xml</code> file \
    (and is not inside another project) will be considered an automatic project. \
    You can just use <b>File > Open</b> to open the project folder right away.</p>\
    <p>If this mode is disabled, you need to use <b>File > New Project</b> to mark the folder as a project for the first time \
    (after that it can be opened directly). \
    You need to use the <b>New Project</b> wizard anyway in case there is a build script but only in a subdirectory.</p>\
    <p>Some users have reported problems creating other kinds of projects, such as freeform projects, when automatic detection mode is on.</p>
