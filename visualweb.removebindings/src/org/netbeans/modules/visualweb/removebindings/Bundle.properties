OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Prior to NetBeans IDE 6.0 release VisualWeb Pages use to generate a binding attribute in the tag for every component in the page. \
    Some of these bindings are never used. \
    Therefore it is safe to remove such unused binding attributes (and the corresponding property field, getter and setter in the backing page bean). \
    In fact, starting with NetBeans IDE  6.1  (M1+) release the binding attribute is not generated by default. \
    Instead the user can add and remove the binding attribute by invoking the action in the component's pop up menu. \
    For details, see - http://wiki.netbeans.org/OnDemandBindingAttribute . \
    All this is well and good for projects developed using the NetBeans 6.1 IDE. \
    However the projects developed prior to NetBeanse IDE 6.1 IDE do not benefit from this feature. \
    That is where this module comes for the rescue. \
    This module installs the action - 'Remove unused binding attributes in the VisualWeb JSF Pages' in the projects' pop up menu. \
    When the action is invoked it shows a confirmation dialog. \
    Once the user confirms the action, the unused binding attributes (and the corresponding property field, getter and setter in the backing page bean) are removed from all the VisualWeb JSF pages in the VisualWeb project. \
    The output window shows the processing messages.
