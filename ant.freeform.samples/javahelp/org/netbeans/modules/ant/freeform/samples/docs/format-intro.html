In NetBeans IDE 4.0 and later, you may create projects "...with Existing Ant
Script", henceforth "freeform" projects. While there are several New Project
wizards they all create the same kind of project, just with different initial
configuration.

For many purposes the IDE's bundled JavaHelp will suffice to explain how to
create and use this project type. See topics under "IDE Basics &gt; Working with
Projects &gt; Free-Form Projects" in Help &gt; Contents. You may need to do some
common types of manual customizations to the project in areas where the IDE's
GUI does not yet support you; a variety of common tasks can be performed using
the instructions given here:

http://www.netbeans.org/kb/41/freeform-config.html

This document tries to explain the configuration format of freeform projects in
detail, for those who need to do more advanced things.
