This is the main section for the project, and it is mandatory.


&lt;name&gt;Stuff&lt;/name&gt; [required] - gives a display name for the project will be
used throughout the IDE.


&lt;properties&gt; [optional] - defines some Ant properties that can be referenced
elsewhere in project.xml, using the same ${propertyname} syntax as Ant uses.
There are two kinds of subelements:

&lt;property name="key"&gt;value&lt;/property&gt; - defines a property 'key' with the value
'value'. Similar to Ant &lt;property name="key" value="value"/&gt;. As with Ant, the
value can use other Ant properties defined earlier in &lt;properties&gt;.

&lt;property-file&gt;file.properties&lt;/property-file&gt; - loads 'file.properties' for its
definitions. Similar to Ant &lt;property file="file.properties"/&gt;. The filename can
use other Ant properties. As with Ant, the definitions in the file can refer to
other Ant properties defined earlier in &lt;properties&gt;; or even other Ant
properties defined in 'file.properties' (so long as there is not a cyclic
definition, of course).


&lt;folders&gt; [optional] - enumerates file locations that are "owned" by this project.

By default, everything underneath the main project directory (parent of
'nbproject') is owned by this project, unless it is part of a nested project.
"Ownership" in the IDE can easily be seen by selecting a file in the Projects,
Files, or Favorites tab and checking the title bar of the main window. A project
decides how files it owns should be treated for purposes of compilation, etc.

Using &lt;folders&gt; you can specify that externally located files are also to be
owned by this project. Permitted child elements are &lt;source-folder&gt; and
&lt;build-folder&gt;.

&lt;source-folder&gt;
    &lt;label&gt;Project Sources&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;location&gt;${home}&lt;/location&gt;
&lt;/source-folder&gt;

This specifies that everything under ${home} (which must have been defined using
&lt;properties&gt;, above) is owned by this project. This directory will be displayed
as e.g. '&lt;project name&gt; - Project Sources' in the Files tab. If you use File &gt;
New to add a text file to the project, 'Project Sources' will be offered as a
possible location.

&lt;source-folder&gt;
    &lt;label&gt;Main Java Sources&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;type&gt;java&lt;/type&gt;
    &lt;location&gt;${home}/java&lt;/location&gt;
&lt;/source-folder&gt;

This specifies that ${home}/java should be treated as a folder of Java sources
arranged in a package structure. File &gt; New will offer this as a choice for
where to put new Java classes.

Note that the '/' in '${home}/java' works on Windows as well as Unix, just as in
Ant; '\' is permitted and equivalent. Also note that relative paths are resolved
against the project directory, just as they would be from a build.xml at top
level using basedir="." (or no explicit basedir).

&lt;build-folder&gt;
    &lt;location&gt;${build}&lt;/location&gt;
&lt;/build-folder&gt;

This specifies that ${build} is a folder which contains build products from the
project. It is thus to be "owned" by the project but not expected to be shared
with other users (e.g. in version control). Not much used yet, but planned to
be:

&lt;ide-actions&gt; [optional] - binds predefined actions in the IDE GUI (e.g. Build
Project) to Ant targets of your choice. You can make simple bindings to actions
which take effect on the whole project, as well as "context-aware" bindings that
let you somehow process particular files which have been selected (in the
editor, Projects/Files tabs, etc.).

&lt;action name="rebuild"&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;${home}/build.xml&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;target&gt;clean&lt;/target&gt;
    &lt;target&gt;build&lt;/target&gt;
    &lt;property name="set-from-ide"&gt;true&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/action&gt;

This binds the IDE action "Clean and Build Project" to targets in the Ant script
in ${home}/build.xml. (Default script if not specified: 'build.xml', i.e. at top
level in the project.) &lt;target&gt; may be specified once, or several times (to run
in sequence), or not at all (to use the default target) - all as on the Ant
command line. You can use &lt;property&gt; elements to pass some special definitions
to the target(s), just like -D on the Ant command line.

&lt;action name="debug.fix"&gt;
    &lt;target&gt;debug-fix-nb&lt;/target&gt;
    &lt;context&gt;
        &lt;property&gt;fix.file&lt;/property&gt;
        &lt;folder&gt;src&lt;/folder&gt;
        &lt;pattern&gt;\.java$&lt;/pattern&gt;
        &lt;format&gt;relative-path-noext&lt;/format&gt;
        &lt;arity&gt;
            &lt;one-file-only/&gt;
        &lt;/arity&gt;
    &lt;/context&gt;
&lt;/action&gt;

This binds the IDE action "Fix" (used by the debugger) to a target
'debug-fix-nb'. It will be enabled for a selection consisting of one *.java file
in the project's 'src' subdirectory (the regular expression must match the
relative path, using '/' as a separator, from the root folder); the path to the
source (in the format 'org/foo/pkg/Clazz' for a file src/org/foo/pkg/Clazz.java)
will be passed to the target in the property named 'fix.file'.

The possible formats are:

absolute-path       - the full path to the file in native format
absolute-path-noext - the full path to the file, minus any .ext
relative-path       - the relative path from the folder ('/' separated)
relative-path-noext - the relative path minus any .ext
java-name           - a no-extension path with '.', e.g. 'org.foo.pkg.Clazz'

Currently you can only pass one "context" property at a time, which can be
cumbersome:

http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=48079

&lt;action name="compile.single"&gt;
    &lt;target&gt;compile-selected-files&lt;/target&gt;
    &lt;context&gt;
        &lt;property&gt;includes&lt;/property&gt;
        &lt;folder&gt;src&lt;/folder&gt;
        &lt;pattern&gt;\.java$&lt;/pattern&gt;
        &lt;format&gt;relative-path&lt;/format&gt;
        &lt;arity&gt;
            &lt;separated-files&gt;,&lt;/separated-files&gt;
        &lt;/arity&gt;
    &lt;/context&gt;
&lt;/action&gt;

This binds "Compile Single" to the target 'compile-selected-files'. It will be
enabled for one or more Java sources in 'src'. The context is equivalent to
calling command-line Ant something like this:

ant -Dincludes=org/foo/pkg/Clazz1.java,org/foo/pkg/Clazz2.java compile-selected-files

Currently you cannot have the action be enabled on a folder (or package):

&lt;export&gt; [optional, may be repeated] - defines a build product of the project
that may be seen by other IDE projects or IDE features. Permits this project to
be used as a subproject of a plain Java project, for example.

&lt;export&gt;
    &lt;type&gt;jar&lt;/type&gt;
    &lt;location&gt;${build.dir}/${build.jar}&lt;/location&gt;
    &lt;!-- optional: &lt;script&gt;${home}/build.xml&lt;/script&gt; --&gt;
    &lt;build-target&gt;jar&lt;/build-target&gt;
    &lt;clean-target&gt;clean&lt;/clean-target&gt; &lt;!-- optional --&gt;
&lt;/export&gt;

Declares that the file ${build.dir}/${build.jar} is to be exported as a JAR
build product of this project. (&lt;type&gt; should always be 'folder' or 'jar' for
use from plain Java projects, but other project types may define other kinds of
exports.) If used as a subproject of a plain Java project,
${build.dir}/${build.jar} will be added to the parent project's classpath;
build-impl.xml in the parent project will call this project's build.xml#jar when
"building dependencies", and build.xml#clean when "cleaning dependencies".


&lt;view&gt; [optional] - specifies what to show in the Projects tab, in the intended
order. Entries may be

&lt;source-folder style="packages"&gt;
    &lt;label&gt;Sources&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;location&gt;${src.dir}&lt;/location&gt;
&lt;/source-folder&gt;

Shows a package list view of ${src.dir}, labelled "Sources". (The label is
optional.)

&lt;source-folder style="tree"&gt;
    &lt;label&gt;Docs&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;location&gt;docs&lt;/location&gt;
&lt;/source-folder&gt;

Shows the subdir 'docs' in a plain tree.

&lt;source-file&gt;
    &lt;label&gt;Build Script&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;location&gt;build.xml&lt;/location&gt;
&lt;/source-file&gt;

Shows 'build.xml'.

After view items you may specify project-specific context menu items for the
project's root node:

&lt;context-menu&gt;
    &lt;ide-action name="build"/&gt;
    &lt;ide-action name="clean"/&gt;
    &lt;ide-action name="rebuild"/&gt;
    &lt;separator/&gt;
    &lt;action&gt;
        &lt;!-- optional: &lt;script&gt;build.xml&lt;/script --&gt;
        &lt;label&gt;Format Sources&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;target&gt;jalopy&lt;/target&gt;
        &lt;!-- optional: &lt;property name="..."&gt;...&lt;/property&gt; --&gt;
    &lt;/action&gt;
&lt;/context-menu&gt;

The &lt;ide-action&gt;s must refer to context-free predefined actions, as above. For
the rest you can specify an action inline by just giving a label and an Ant
target.


&lt;subprojects&gt; [optional] - informs the IDE of other projects which should be
considered "required projects" for purposes of the Open Required Projects
context menu item, the checkbox in the Open Project dialog, etc.

&lt;subprojects&gt;
    &lt;project&gt;subdir-with-project&lt;/project&gt;
    &lt;project&gt;${other.project.dir}&lt;/project&gt;
&lt;/subprojects&gt;
