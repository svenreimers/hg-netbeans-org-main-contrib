        <h2>Metadata Best Practices</h2>
        <p>
            The first thing to keep in mind is that a freeform <code>project.xml</code> does not
            determine <em>how</em> a project is built or run—that is done by an Ant script. The
            <code>project.xml</code> <em>declares</em> to the IDE what the project contains and produces, and
            which parts of the Ant script should be exposed in the IDE’s GUI to the
            developer. So you should always start by writing a well-structured and flexible
            Ant script that does what you want it to do (either on the command line or by
            invoking targets from the IDE). Then you can create a freeform project wrapper
            that presents the project in an attractive and efficient way and lets IDE
            features such as code completion work the way you expect.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ant properties can be used to good effect in your <code>project.xml</code>. Typically you
            will have some property definitions which are contained in one or more
            <code>*.properties</code> files and will define important aspects of the project, such as JAR
            files to include in the classpath, build locations, etc. The Ant script can load
            these properties files and the IDE can too. If you need to make configuration
            changes, make them in the properties files—the Ant build will honor them and
            the IDE should as well.
