        <h2>Anagram Sample Project Pair</h2>
        <p>
            This wizard creates a pair of freeform projects which together implement the
            same application as the IDE’s standard <b>Anagram Game</b> project sample.
            One project holds a nonvisual library (with accompanying unit tests), and the
            other project depends on the library and contains a runnable Swing-based GUI.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main point of interest for this sample beyond what is available in the
            <a href="template-skeletal.html">Skeletal Project Template</a> is that you
            can see an interproject dependency in action, working much like dependencies
            between regular Java projects:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Building the GUI project automatically builds the library project as well.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The classes built by the library project are included in the classpath of
                    the GUI project; code completion, <b>Go to Source</b>, and other IDE features
                    work across the projects as you would expect.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The library project is treated as a subproject of the GUI project for purposes
                    of <b>Open Project</b> and <b>Open Required Projects</b>.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </body>
