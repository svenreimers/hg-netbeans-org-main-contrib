        <h2>Using the NetBeans Integration of the Debugger</h2>
        <p>
            To launch the debugger on the main class of your main project, just click
            <b>Omniscient Debug Main Project</b> in the NetBeans toolbar or <b>Run</b> menu.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may also right-click any project and select <b>Omniscient Debug Project</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may debug a single file using <b>Run | Run File | Omniscient Debug File</b>.
            (Also in the context menu for Java sources.) The file must either have a
            <code>main</code> method or be a JUnit test.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the debugger is running, NetBeans is not involved; refer to the debugger
            user manual for details on how to use it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The initial configuration for the debugger is kept in <code>nbproject/private/cache/.debuggerDefaults</code>
            and there is a <code>omnidebug.xml</code> Ant script in the same directory which you may
            run by hand if you want to repeat the same debugger run. The IDE uses the debugger's
            default configuration except for the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The class name is of course set according to your main class or unit test.
            </li>
            <li>
                The class path is whatever you configure for the runtime classpath of your project.
            </li>
            <li>
                All classes in the project being debugged are instrumented.
                Additionally, all classes open in the editor are instrumented.
            </li>
            <li>
                Source associations for all classes in the class path are made
                available to the debugger where possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                If your main class imports some AWT or Swing classes, the IDE guesses that it is a GUI
                application and asks the debugger to not stop recording when the main method exits.
            </li>
            <li>
                An attempt is made to pass the same system properties to your main class or test
                as the regular project's Ant script would use.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </body>
