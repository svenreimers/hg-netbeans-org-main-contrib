You'll need the smack library, available for download at
http://www.jivesoftware.com/xmpp/smack/
This code was developed and tested with smack version 1.3

The library is available under modified Apache license, so it
may be added later directly to the cvs.

Download the library and copy the files smack.jar and smackx.jar
to this directory.
