* How to build
-------------------------------

The module depends on openide/convertor which is not part of the platform by
default. You will need to go to nbbuild and run this anytime after the clean build:

ant -Dmodules= -Dfixedmodules=openide/convertor merge

After that the PrimitiveSettings module will build/run normally.
