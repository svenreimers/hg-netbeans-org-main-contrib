<h2> User Tasks View </h2>
<p>The <a href="http://tasklist.netbeans.org">User Tasks</a>
module lets you record your own todo list. Tasks have properties like
priority, description, date created, last modification date, etc. You
can choose which properties are visible in the tasklist, and sort by
any column. The task list is stored in a standard format which can be
read by other calendar applications, such as Evolution, Korganizer, and
others. <br>
</p>
<p>You can also <a href="translators.html">export</a> the tasklist to
HTML or XML. To show the user
tasks window, click this icon in the
tasklist toolbar: <img src="taskView.gif"> or choose "Window", "User
Tasks" from the main menu.
</p>
<p>The user task list allows you to record tasks for yourself.
For example, "Bring ethernet cable to work tomorrow", or
if you're looking at some code, "Refactor the Engine class".
These "todo items" are recorded into a tasklist file which is
stored in a standard format, which means you can open the file
in other calendar tools such as Gnome's Evolution, KDE's
Korganizer, and many commercial tools as well.
</p>
<p>Recurring tasks, like "Mom's birthday tomorrow!" are not supported
yet but task # <a
 href="http://tasklist.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=26455">26445</a>
is tracking it.<br>
</p>
<p>You can search for tasks/filter them using the <a href="filter.html">filter
dialog</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>Tasks can have an <a href="addTask.html">associated</a> file
position (filename and line
number)
or a URL. Then, when you select the "Go to Task" action on the task,
the given position is shown in the source editor or a browser window. A
task associated with a file will also be shown on the error stripe in
the editor.<br>
</p>
<p>You can customize which task properties are shown in the list,
change the sorting order, etc. See the <a href="table-operation.html">Using
the Table</a> document
for details on how to do that.
</p>
<p>Right click with the mouse to bring up the local menu and choose one
of the available <a href="actions.html">actions</a> (some of them are
also available in the local menu bar).<br>
</p>
<p>By default, there is a "global" tasklist where your tasks are
stored. This tasklist is kept in the user directory, although
you can change its location. You can however use multiple tasklists.
This allows you to have one (or more) tasklist per project, for
example. To create a new tasklist, use the "New From Template"
feature in the IDE, and drill into "TaskList" and select iCalendar.
When you've picked a name and a location,
a new empty tasklist is created and shown.
</p>
<p>You can treat the tasklist files like any other source content
and put it under version control, share it with other users, etc.<br>
</p>
<p>There are also some <a href="options.html">options</a> associated
with the user tasks view.<br>
