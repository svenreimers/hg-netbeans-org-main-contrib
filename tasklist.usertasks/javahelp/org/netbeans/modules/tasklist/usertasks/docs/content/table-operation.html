<h2> Using the Task List Table</h2>








<h3>Choosing visible columns/Sorting/Editing</h3>








Tasks have many properties, and by default only a few of
these properties are shown in the task list table. You can set
the sorting column by simply clicking on a table header.
Clicking repeatedly will reverse the sort order and turn off the
sorting.
Use F2 to start editing a cell.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also change the visible columns by clicking the
little icon (<img src="images/columns.gif" title="" alt="Columns" style="width: 12px; height: 12px;">)
which
appears to the right of the table headers,
straight above the vertical scrollbar (see image below). You may select
multiple tasks and change some properties of the selected tasks at
once. The view also remembers selected tasks and scrollbar positions.
Different icons are used for undone (<img src="images/task.gif" alt="Task" style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">) and
done (<img src="images/doneItem.gif" alt="Done item" style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">) tasks.
The same icons are used in
the editor if a line is associated with the task. Tasks can also be expanded/collapsed using keyboard (Right/Left).<br>

<br>

If a task list is presented as a plain list without category tasks sorting a column leads also to automatic grouping.<br>






<br>






Drag &amp; Drop support:<br>






<ul>






  <li>columns can be reordered&nbsp;by dragging
them around</li>






  <li>tasks can be moved and copied (use system specific modifier keys like Control in KDE)</li>






  <li>dropping a task over an editor pastes it's summary</li>






  <li>dropping some text over a task creates a new one (dragged text is used for summary of newly created task)</li>


  <li>dropping a link from <a href="http://www.firefox.com">Firefox</a> creates a task with page's title as the summary and corresponding URL</li>






</ul>
