<h2> Using the Task List Table</h2>
<h3>Choosing visible columns/Sorting/Editing</h3>
Tasks have many properties, and by default only a few of
these properties are shown in the task list table. You can set
the sorting column by simply clicking on a table header.
Clicking repeatedly will reverse the sort order and turn off the
sorting.
Use F2 to start editing a cell. Note that you can also reorder columns
by dragging
them around. You can also change the visible columns by clicking the
little icon (<img src="columns.gif" title="" alt="Columns"
 style="width: 12px; height: 12px;">) which
appears to the right of the table headers,
straight above the vertical scrollbar (see image below). You may select
multiple tasks and change some properties of the selected tasks at
once. The view also remembers selected tasks and scrollbar positions.

</p>
<h3>Summary column</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Different icons are used for undone (<img src="task.gif" title=""
 alt="Task" style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">) and done (<img
 src="doneItem.gif" title="" alt="Done item"
 style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">) tasks. The same icons are used in
the editor if a line is associated with the task.<br>
</p>
<h3>Effort column</h3>
Effort cells are painted
in red using a bold font if the sum of the spent time and the remaining
effort exceeds
the planed effort.<br>
<h3>Completed column</h3>
This columns contains the date when a particular task was completed. It
will be filled automatically if you mark a task as done.<br>
<h3>Associating a line with a task</h3>
You can <a href="addTask.html">associate</a> a line in a file with a
task. Selected task will also be highlighted in the editor with the
yellow
background:<br>
<p><img src="editor.gif" title="" alt="Selected task in the editor"
 style="width: 686px; height: 92px;"><br>
</p>
<h3>Starting/stopping a task</h3>
A task can be started by choosing "<a href="actions.html">Start</a>"
from the local menu or by clicking on the icon in the local toolbar (<img
 src="startTask.gif" title="" alt="Start a task"
 style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">). The small icon (<img
 src="startedBadge.gif" title="" alt="Started"
 style="width: 8px; height: 8px;">) marks the
task that you are currently working on. Started task will remain
started after a NetBeans restart. The owner of a started task will be
set to the name of the current user if it was empty.<br>
