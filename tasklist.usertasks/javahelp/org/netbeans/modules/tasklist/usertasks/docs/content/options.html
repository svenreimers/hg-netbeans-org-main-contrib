<h2>User Task List Options </h2>

<p>
To customize options related to the User Tasks view,
open the Options dialog (Tools &gt; Options),
and then drill down to Miscellaneous&gt; User Tasks.</p>

<p><img alt="User Tasks Options" src="images/options.jpeg"><br>

</p>

<p>The following settings are available:
</p>

<ul>

  <li> <b>Append instead of Prepend</b>: Instead of
prepending tasks
to the list, append them to the end. Default: False. This is handy if
you're going to type in a list of tasks in sequential order and would
like the resulting list to be in the same order as the one you typed it
in, not the reverse. </li>

  <li> <b>Save Backups</b>: When true, save a backup
of the previous
version of the tasklist once per session. Default: True. Backups use
the tasklist file's name plus a trailing ~, e.g.
{userdir}/tasklist.ics~.</li>

  <li><b>Collect Work Periods:</b> if
this option is switched on, the time periods when you work on a task
are collected and shown in the tab "Work Periods" in the <a href="newTaskDialog.html">"Show Task" dialog</a>.</li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Detect
Inactivity:</span> if
this option is on, a running task will be suspended after 10 minutes
you do not use your mouse or keyboard (it works only if you work with
NetBeans all the time).<br>

  </li>

  <li><b>Hours per Day: </b>number of working hours
per day</li>

  <li><b>Days per Week: </b>number of working days
per week</li>

  <li><b>Automatically Switch "Spent Time", "Effort" and
"Percent
Complete" to "Computed" if a subtask is added:</b> if you create
a new
subtask the corresponding values of the parent task will be computed
automatically.<br>

  </li>

  <li><b>Default User Tasks File</b>: Name of file
where the tasks are
stored.
Default: {userdir}/tasklist.ics. </li>

</ul>
