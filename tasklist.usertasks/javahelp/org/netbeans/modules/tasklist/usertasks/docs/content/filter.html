<h2> Searching for Tasks </h2>
To search for a particular task, or to only show
tasks matching a given set of criteria, use the
"Search/Filter..." context menu action. This will
bring up a dialog like the following:
<p><img src="filter.gif" title="" alt="Filter dialog"
 style="width: 808px; height: 585px;"></p>
<p>Use the "New" button to create a new filter and "Delete" to delete
the selected (current) filter. The "Preview" button allows to see the
results without closing the dialog.<br>
</p>
<p>To add additional search criteria, click on the
"More" button. To remove the last condition from
the list, click on the "Fewer" button. By default
a task is accepted if it matches <i>any</i> of
the conditions. Select the "Match all of the following"
checkbox to require ALL conditions to be met.
</p>
<p>If a task has subtasks, and the task itself does
not match the criteria but one or more of its
subtasks do it will cause the
(non-matching) parent task to be included in the tasklist, but with a
gray icon. This means you can still see the original structure of the
tasklist. Here's how this looks:</p>
<p><img src="parents.gif" title=""
 alt="Filtered view with unmatched parent tasks"
 style="width: 175px; height: 53px;"></p>
<p>Note that clicking on the "Search" icon in the
toolbar when a tasklist window is active brings
up the filter dialog.
</p>
<p>Filters are preserved from session
to session.
