/**
 * The SuggestionManager manages suggestions, suggestion providers,
 * etc. Modules can obtain a reference to the SuggestionManager
 * and then register suggestions.
 * <p>
 * Here's how you add suggestions to the tasklist:
 * <ol>
 *  <li> Obtain a reference to the SuggestionManager:
 *    <pre>
 *      SuggestionManager manager = SuggestionManager.getDefault();
 *    </pre>
 *    Note: this may return null (in the case where the Suggestions
 *    module is not available/enabled) so check the return value!
 *    <p>
 *  <li> Check to make sure that the type of suggestion you're about
 *       to add is welcome by the user:
 *    <pre>
 *       if (manager.isEnabled(suggestionTypeId) &&
 *           manager.isObserved(suggestionTypeId)) {
 *    </pre>
 *    <p>
 *  <li> Create a new {@link org.netbeans.modules.tasklist.client.Suggestion}:
 *    <pre>
 *       Suggestion suggestion = manager.createSuggestion("myid",
 *                                     "my suggestion description",
 *           new SuggestionPerformer() {
 *             public void perform(Suggestion s) {
 *                beep();
 *             }
 *             public Object getConfirmation(Suggestion s) {
 *                return null;
 *             }
 *             public boolean hasConfirmation() {
 *                return false;
 *             }
 *           },
 *           null
 *       );
 *       suggestion.setPriority(SuggestionPriority.HIGH);
 *    </pre>
 *   <li> Register the suggestion with the SuggestionManager:
 *    <pre>
 *       List addList = new ArrayList(1);
 *       addList.add(suggestion);
 *       manager.register("myid", addList, null, null);
 *    </pre>
 * </ol>
 * Done! (Also see the {@link org.netbeans.modules.tasklist.providers.SuggestionProvider}
 * API for how to write specialized suggestion providers. The above
 * scenario is optimized for the case where you're already doing some
 * computation where you have suggestions as a side effect. If you
 * want to write some code which is only run if the suggestions window
 * is visible etc. etc. that's a better route.)

     * @param type The type of this suggestion. This is a unique string
     *             id, which corresponds to the layer-declaration of a
     *             Suggestion Type which has a user description; you can

     *             type of Suggestion has been disabled by the user.
     * @param summary A one-line summary of the task; this is what appears
     *             in the Suggestions Window main column.
     * @param action An action to be performed when the user "runs" this
     *             task. Some actions may actually fix the problem that
     *             the suggestion is  describing, for example "update
     *             the copyright to include 2002" might edit the document
     *             when the action is run; other actions may point the
     *             user to the problem: the compiler may add tasks to
     *             fix errors and running these actions open the editor
     *             on the relevant source line. This parameter may be
     *             null. This is typically the case for suggestions where
     *             we can't safely fix the problem, and only "Go To
     *             Source" is provided.
     * @param seed Initial provider's data provided for this suggestion,
     *             if any. May be null.
     * @return A new suggestion matching the input parameters which can then
     *             be registered with the manager.
     *
     * @since 1.4
     *
     * @todo Provide specific guidelines here for how these sentences
     *       should be worded so that we get a consistent set of
     *       descriptions.
     *
     * @todo Support multiple actions solving found problems instead
     *       of current practice (reporting it as several suggestions).
