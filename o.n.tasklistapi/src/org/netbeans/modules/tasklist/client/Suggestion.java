/**
 * A suggestion is an item in the Suggestions Viev. It has an associated
 * description/summary, an associated icon, an associated action, etc.
 * <p>
 * Suggestions have an associated "type".  For example, there
 *       is a copyright suggestion which adds suggestions for how to
 *       fix copyrights in your files; whenever it sees you editing a file
 *       where the current year is not included, it will add a specific
 *       suggestion which when performed edits your code to update the
 *       copyright. These copyright suggestions all have the same
 *       suggestion type: copyright. 
 * 
 * <p>
 * This type is used for two purposes:
 * <ul>
 *  <li> Enabling/disabling a class of suggestions. If the user doesn't
 *       want to change the copyright years, the user can disable
 *       this type of suggestion and it will no longer appear in the
 *       suggestion list.
 *  <li> Filtering the list. For example, you can choose to see only the
 *       suggestions pertaining to code metrics.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 *
 * If you are providing suggestions, you need to create a new Suggestion
 * Type for yourself. It's very easy. All you need to do is pick a unique
 * id, and a brief (4 words or less) description.
 * For example, the background compilation of java files may add suggestions
 * that list the error messages and file position; the description of this
 * suggestion type should be "Compiler Errors". This text will be shown
 * in the popup menu where users can filter the list by suggestion type
 * ("Show -> "All", "Compiler Errors", "Copyright Problems", "Audit Problems",
 *  "Performance Hotspots", etc.).
 * <p>
 * Then just register this suggestion type in your module's XML layer file,
 * by adding something like this (under the top level &lt;filesystem&gt; tag) :
 *

 * <pre>
 *     &lt;folder name="Suggestions"&gt; 
 *         &lt;folder name="Types"&gt; 
 *             &lt;file name="copyrightcheck.xml" url="copyrightcheck.xml"/&gt;
 *         &lt;/folder&gt;
 *     &lt;/folder&gt;
 * </pre>
 * and then the file copyrightcheck.xml in your module (in the same
 * directory as your layer file) contains something like this:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
 * &lt;!DOCTYPE type PUBLIC "-//NetBeans//DTD suggestion type 1.0//EN" "http://www.netbeans.org/dtds/suggestion-type-1_0.dtd"&gt;
 * &lt;type
 *     name='CopyrightCheck'
 *     description_key='HINT_COPYRIGHT'
 *     long_description_key='HINT_COPYRIGHT'
 *     localizing_bundle='com.foo.bar.Bundle'
 *     icon='nbresloc:/com/foo/bar/copyrightCheck.gif'
 * /&gt;
 * 
 * </pre>
 *  <p>
 * Then in your Bundle file identified above, add an entry like:
 * <pre>
 *     HINT_COPYRIGHT=Copyright Problems
 *    LONGHINT_copyrighttype=Identify copyright notices in files where the copyright year does not include the current year.
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Finally, pass in "copyrights" as the id for this type of suggestion
 * to the Suggestion constructor as the type argument.
 * Note: type ids have to be unique, so make sure you pick some string
 * which is not going to conflict with any other modules' registered
 * suggestion types. The "copyrights" example could probably be made
 * more unique by adding a company prefix to it, e.g.
 * "com.foo.bar-copyrights". I recommend you do that. For NetBeans
 * modules (e.g. modules hosted on NetBeans' CVS server", simply use
 * "nb-{modulename}-whatever". For example, the tasklist module would
 * use a prefix of "nb-tasklist-".
