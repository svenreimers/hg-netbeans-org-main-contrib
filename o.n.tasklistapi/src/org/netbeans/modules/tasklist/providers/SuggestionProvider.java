/**
 * A suggestion provider provides Suggestions to the SuggestionManager.
 *
 * Classes which exist exclusively to produce suggestions are most likely
 * SuggestionProviders rather than simple SuggestionManager clients.
 * (If you're computing something and have a result that may be useful
 * as a Suggestion, you don't need to make this into a SuggestionProvider;
 * simply look up the SuggestionManager and register the Suggestion.)
 * <p>
 * The API does not define which thread these methods are called on,
 * so don't make any assumptions. If you want to post something on
 * the AWT event dispatching thread for example use SwingUtilities.
 * <p>
 * @todo Document threading behavior
 * @todo Document timer behavior (some of the methods are called after
 *   a delay, others are called immediately.)
 * @todo Add a reference to how SuggestionProviders are registered here?
