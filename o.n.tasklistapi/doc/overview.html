<!-- unused, just for tidy: --><title>TaskList API Overview</title>
<body>

This document set describes the public APIs offered by the
<a href="http://tasklist.netbeans.org/">TaskList module</a>.
<p>
The first thing you need to decide is: should you use the API
or the SPI?
<p>
The API is intended for client modules which are already doing
some useful computation, like for example the Audit module.
It will analyze the user's source code and inform the user
of problems. It may also as a side effect add Suggestions into
the Suggestions Window for some of the problems it encounters.
This is a typical API usage of the TaskList APIs.
<p>
The SPI is intended for client modules who want to provide suggestions
to the Suggestions window, and these suggestions are unrelated to
other tasks performed by the module. The SPI classes provide
convenience classes for this, where common scenarios (like providing
suggestions for the current document in the editor or the currently
selected node in the IDE) are tracked automatically, and even the
provider class itself is only created when the Suggestions Window
itself is made visible.
<p>
There are three critical classes you should be aware of:
<ul>
 <li> {@link org.netbeans.api.tasklist.Suggestion} - you create one of these and register
      it with the SuggestionManager. This will cause the suggestion
      to show up in the Suggestions Window.  Suggestion is a bean
      and has attributes like a description, an icon, a priority,
      etc.
 <li> {@link org.netbeans.api.tasklist.SuggestionManager} - 
      this manager keeps track of the
      Suggestions in the system; you register (and unregister)
      suggestions with the manager to manipulate the suggestion
      list. In addition, the SuggestionManager also keeps track
      of which -types- of suggestions the user is interested in
      and blocks anything the user has chosen not to see.
 <li> {@link org.netbeans.api.tasklist.SuggestionPerformer} - 
      each Suggestion has an associated
      action, and it is the SuggestionPerformer that is responsible
      for actually performing this action. In addition, the
      SuggestionPerformer is responsible for describing the action
      for the confirmation dialog, and it can also provide a
      customizer so that the user can customize how the action
      is carried out.
</ul>
<p>
In addition to the above classes, there is also the concept of
a <b>SuggestionType</b>. It does not have a corresponding class;
SuggestionTypes are simply registered via the layer file.
Each Suggestion is considered to have an associated SuggestionType.
For example, the three suggestions
<ul>
  <li> Import java.io.IOException into Foo.java
  <li> Import java.util.List into Bar.java
  <li> Import java.awt.List into Bar.java
</ul>
all have the same suggestion type, "Import Suggestions". 
SuggestionTypes are important because the user gets to
enable/disable suggestions based on their type, and the
user can also filter the Suggestions View to show only suggestions
of a particular type. See the Suggestion API for more information
on how to register Suggestion Types.
<p>
To use the TaskList APIs, you should add a dependency on the
tasklist-api module in your manifest.mf file:
<pre>
OpenIDE-Module-Module-Dependencies: org.netbeans.api.tasklist/1 &gt; 1.0
</pre>
If you want your module to -require- that the Suggestions window
module is available, you can also add this:
<pre>
OpenIDE-Module-Requires: org.netbeans.api.tasklist.SuggestionManager
</pre>
<p>
Proceed to either the API or SPI packages to get more information
on how to add Suggestions to the Suggestions Window.
