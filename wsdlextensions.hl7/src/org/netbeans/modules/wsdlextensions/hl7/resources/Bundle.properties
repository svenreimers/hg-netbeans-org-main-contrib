OpenIDE-Module-Name=HL7 WSDL Extension
OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=HL7 Extension for WSDL Editor.
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=This module provides HL7 schema and plugs into WSDL Editor.
OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category=CAPS
WSDLEditor/Binding/HL7Binding= HL7 Binding
WSDLEditor/BindingOperation/HL7BindingOperation= HL7 Operation
WSDLEditor/BindingOperationInput/HL7Message= HL7 Message
DESC_Element_binding="binding" indicates a hl7 protocol based binding.
DESC_Element_operation="operation" indicates a hl7 protocol based operation.
DESC_Element_message="message" indicates a hl7 protocol based HL7 message to/from WSDL message mapping
DESC_Attribute_part=Defines the references to the abstract message part in the WSDL.
DESC_Attribute_use=The use type which affects how the message is interpreted. The default is "encoded"
DESC_Attribute_encodingStyle=when use is encoded, this attribute defines the encoding style
DESC_Element_address="address" indicates a hl7 protocol based service address.
DESC_Attribute_location=The connectivity information to connect to HL7 Server. Format hl7://ip:portnumber
DESC_Attribute_transportProtocolName=The transport protocol to use to tranport the hl7 messages
DESC_Element_protocolproperties="protocolproperties" indicates hl7 protocol properties.
DESC_Attribute_acknowledgmentMode=Defines the acknowledgement mode to use to acknowledge the hl7 transactions
DESC_Attribute_llpType=Defines the type of Lower Layer Protocol to use
DESC_Attribute_startBlockCharacter=Defines Start Block Character Value in decimal ascii number. The allowed range is 1 to 127. Unless there is a conflict, the value should be ASCII VT, i.e., decimal 11.
DESC_Attribute_endDataCharacter=Defines End Data Character Value in decimal ascii number. The allowed range is 1 to 127. Unless there is a conflict, the value should be ASCII FS, i.e., decimal 28.
DESC_Attribute_endBlockCharacter=Defines End Block Character Value in decimal ascii number. The allowed range is 1 to 127. To be strictly compliant with the HL7 Standard, this parameter MUST be set to a Carriage Return, i.e., decimal 13.
DESC_Attribute_hllpChecksumEnabled=Enables or disables HLLP Checksum
DESC_Attribute_seqNumEnabled=Enables or disables sequence number protocol
DESC_Attribute_processingID=Defines the ProcessingID value against which MSH-11-ProcessingID field in the received message is validated when validateMSH is set to true. Valid values are "P", "D" or "T"
DESC_Attribute_versionID=Defines the versionID value against which MSH-12-VersionID field in the received message is validated when validateMSH is set to true. Valid values are "2.1", "2.2" , "2.3", "2.3.1", "2.4", "2.5", "2.5.1" or "3.0"
DESC_Attribute_validateMSH=Enables or disables the MSH segment validation
DESC_Attribute_enabledSFT=Enables or disables SFT segment processing
DESC_Attribute_softwareVendorOrganization=Defines the Software Vendor Organization field (SFT-1-Software Vendor Organization) which identifies the vendor who is responsible for maintaining the application.
DESC_Attribute_softwareCertifiedVersionOrReleaseNumber=Specifies HL7 segment SFT-02, the Software Certified Version or Release Number. The latest software version number or release number for the sending system, helps to provide a more complete profile of the application that is sending or receiving HL7 messages.
DESC_Attribute_softwareProductName=Specifies HL7 segment SFT-03, the name of the software product that submitted the transaction.The software product name is a key component for identifying the sending application.
DESC_Attribute_softwareBinaryID=Specifies HL7 segment SFT-04, the Software Binary ID. This property is available starting with HL7 version 2.5. Software Binary IDs are issued by a vendor for each unique software version instance. These IDs are used to differentiate between differing versions of the same software.Identical Primary IDs indicate that the software is identical at the binary level, but configuration settings may differ.
DESC_Attribute_softwareProductInformation=Specifies HL7 segment SFT-05, software product identification information. This may include a description of the software application, configuration settings,modifications made to the software.
DESC_Attribute_softwareInstallDate=Specifies HL7 segment SFT-06, the Software Install Date. This is the date(format should be YYYYMMDDHHSS) on which the submitting software was installed at the sending site.
DESC_SimpleType_yyyyMMddHHmm=Year Month and Date information.
