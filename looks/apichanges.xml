    <change id="LookSelector.FINAL">
	<api name="looks"/>
	<summary>Redesign of LookSelecotrs</summary>
	<version major="1" minor="9"/>
	<date day="1" month="10" year="2003"/>
	<author login="phrebejk"/>
	<compatibility source="incompatible" 
		       binary="incompatible"
		       modification="yes"/>
	<description>
	In order to implement reasonable caching in selectors
	and in ProxyLook. The LookSelector was made final
	class. Factory methods and LookProviders have to
	be used to create LookSelectors.
	</description>

    <change id="ProxyLook.undelegateObject">
	<api name="looks"/>
	<summary>undelegateObject method added</summary>
	<version major="1" minor="8"/>
	<date day="30" month="7" year="2003"/>
	<author login="phrebejk"/>
	<compatibility addition="yes"/>
	<description>
	ProxyLook allows for changing the representedObject
	for sublooks by overriding the delegateObject method.
	However for correct firing of events from the 
	ProxyLook there needs to be an inverse method also.
	So the undelegateObject method has been added into
	ProxyLook class.

    <change id="Look.fireChange">

	<summary>Simplification of event firing</summary>
	<version major="1" minor="7"/>

	<author login="phrebejk"/>
	<compatibility source="incompatible" 
		       binary="incompatible"
		       modification="yes"/>
	<description>
	Methods for firing (fireNameChange, fireDisplayNameChange,
	fireIconChange, ...) replaced with fireChange( repObj, mask )
	method. Mask allows for firing multiple events. Property
	changes should be fired using firePropertyChange( repObj, propName)
	method. Method number constants moved from ProxyLook to Look
	class.

	<description>
	The method setName() in the Look class has changed it's
	name to rename in Looks 1.1. But this fact was not reflected
	in the name of the constant of this method in ProxyLook.
	These two names need to be in sync thus renaming.

	<api name="looks"/>
	<summary>Making attachTo and detachFrom protected.</summary>
	<version major="1" minor="6"/>
	<date day="2" month="6" year="2003"/>
	<author login="phrebejk"/>
	<compatibility source="incompatible" 
		       binary="incompatible"
		       modification="yes"/>
	<description>
	Methods attachTo and detachFrom are rather SPI than API thus
	makung them protected. This also allows for overriding these
	methods in ProxyLook. These methods are now automatically
	called from add/removeLookListener. The listener cache in
	Look takes care of calling attachTo/detachFrom only once
	per represented object even if the [Look,rep. obj] pair
	is used in more views or in more ProxyLooks. For more info 
	about necessity of this approach see also the EventDeliveryTest.

	<summary>Allowing attachTo method to throw ClassCast or Illegal
		Argument exception when inappropriate object passed
		as parameter</summary>
	<version major="1" minor="5"/>
	<date day="19" month="5" year="2003"/>
	<author login="phrebejk"/>
	<compatibility addition="yes"/>
	<description>
	It should be possible for a Look to state out that the object
	passed as parameter into the attachTo method is invalid for
	given Look, i.e. the look is not able to work with that
	represented object.

        Method fireNodeDestroyed( Object ) renamed to fireObjectDestroyed( ... )
	with same signature. The Looks API should be independent on 
	Nodes as much as possible.

	<description>
	In order to allow access to the represented object given the look node,
        the look node now adds <code>InstanceCookie.Of</code> into its own lookup. Using
	this cookie one can get the represented object from the Node.
