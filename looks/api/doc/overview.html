Looks is an SPI (service provider interface) which permits the definition of
transformations from arbitrary Java objects into a form suitable for
visual representation.

<!-- that was the summary sentence -->

The transformation includes conversion of object 
attributes into atrributes of it's visual representation and conversion
of events fired from praticular object into events suitable for rearanging
the visual representation. 
<p>
The architecture of Looks allows for more independent modules to take 
part in an object visualisation. (I.e. using Looks it is possible for module
A to add child objects to an object originally created and visualised by module
B.)
<p>
Besides the Looks SPI this package also contains a bridge to the current NetBeans
visualisation API,

<i>
The API is still under development and may be changed. The changes will not 
change the general way how the looks API works and can be considered small but 
it is not granted that the changes will be compatoble on either binary or 
source level.<br>
Especially the way how the Looks are registered on the system filesystem 
using module layers will likely undergo some changes when the back end of the 
<a href="@OPENIDE/REGISTRY@/">Registry API</a> 
will change.
