This package contains the whole Look framework. 

<H3>Basic classes</H3>

Basic classes Look, DefaultLook, LookSelector and NamespaceSelector will
be used when defining the transformation between arbitrary represend object 
and it's visual representation. The Look can be think of as factory for
the values used for visual representation of objects. I.e. the Look is
given the object and should return/extract/compute the proper value
(e.g. DisplayName or Icon)<BR>
Look is the class responsible for the transformation of data and events.
Look selector is responsible for finding proper Look (set of Looks) for 
given object where the search can be based on various criteria e.g. type
of the object some (immutable) property of the object etc.
<BR>
Simply extending look will provide a "null" representation so there
won't be any name, any icon etc. Overriding methods in the subclass of Look
allows to return some reasonable values based on properties of the
represented object. The subclass can also decide to implement some listener
interfaces and register on the represented objects in order to 
translate/refire the changes and in turn update the view when some 
property of represented object changes.
<BR>
LookSelectors serve:
<OL>
    <LI>For implementing more advanced Looks search strategies in Proxy/Composite
Looks and for selecting proper Looks for different categories of objects.</LI>
    <LI>For creating an API of modules which need to
allow other modules to modify the visual representation of objects the 
module produces.</LI>
</OL>

<H3>Static factories</H3>


There are two static factories (Looks and Selectors). These factories: 
<OL>
    <LI>Provide some default implementations of Looks for general objects e.g. JavaBeans
or selecting by a type of object.</LI>
    <LI>Second, provide Looks and LookSelectors which execute some general operations
on other Looks/LookSelectors (e.g. composition and filtering)</LI>
</OL>
