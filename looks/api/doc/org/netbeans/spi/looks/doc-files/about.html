<H3><A NAME="1.1">1.1] Why you should know the NodesAPI before reading about Looks</A></H3>

It might be necessary to read a little bit about NodesAPI before starting 
reading about Looks. LooksAPI is more or less originated as an extension of the 
NodesAPI so some knowledge about Nodes is required use the LookAPI correcty. 
A very good source of inforamtion about Nodes is the 
<A HREF="@OPENIDE@/org/openide/nodes/doc-files/api.html">
NodesAPI description</A>. First, it will give you an overall notion about the
nodes acrchitecture and how nodes are bound to the JavaBeans concept. Second
many of the methods in the Look class and in it's subclasses are supposed to
work exactly the way methods in Node do. So if you want to know more about
implementing Cut &amp Paste operations for nodes (no matter whether using looks or not),
then the above mentioned document is the right text to read.
<P>
Short description on nodes follows for those of you who do not want or have no
time to read the NodesAPI description. Developers already knowledgeable about
Nodes are of course encouraged to skip both the NodesAPI description and the 
following paragraph.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="1.2"></A>1.2] What are nodes in short</H3>
Nodes are presentation objects used in the IDE. Presentation in this case should 
not be considered equal to visual representation. Nodes are an layer between objects, 
which should be presented visually (e.g. JavaBeans, FileObjects, Services, Options, etc.) 
and the real visual presentation. In other words the nodes are on the half way
between in-memory object and it's visual presentation on the screen.<BR>
The real visual presentation may vary. The most usuall node representation in
NetBeans is the <A>tree</A> form with a <A>property sheet</A> and actions popup menu in the 
explorer. But there are more types of views available in NetBeans e.g. 
<A>ListView</A>, <A>IconView</A>, <A>TreeTable</A> view etc.<BR>
All these types of views have something in common. You could say that the views
present some kinds of records and allow invocation of some actions on those
records. Nodes are translation of various objects into this unified structures.
The contract of a node is very similar to contract if a JavaBean. For more info see: the
<A HREF="@OPENIDE@/org/openide/nodes/doc-files/api.html">
NodesAPI description</A>. and 
<A HREF="@OPENIDE@/org/openide/nodes/Node.html">
Javadoc for the Node class.</A>
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="2">2] What are Looks</A></H2>

Now, when there already is the Nodes layer in NetBeans why to add something 
new to it? The abstraction of Nodes is quite powerful and useful. But a
common framework for conversion of in-memory representation of data
(java.sql.Result, java.util.List, org.openide.filesystem.FileObject, any 
JavaBean, etc.) into Nodes is missing. Such transformation framework should
be powerfull enough to allow developers easily create semanticaly rich
presentation of the data in theirs applications. It also should allow reuse
of already defined presentations etc. (see below for the main requirements) 
The looks should be seen as such an utility framework which should fill the gap, 
thus make the module developer's life easier, and bring additional improvements 
for the user.<BR>
Notice that the Looks API does not depend directly on Nodes
and it is possible to create Views in future, which only require Looks and no 
nodes. However in the nodes2looks package contains classes and methods to 
allow smooth interoperation between Looks and existing Node based APIs.
<P>
The basic idea behind the looks is that there exists a net of objects which 
have actions/services/methods which can be invoked. The objects also 
have attributes/properties which can be displayed and changed. 
This is quite obvious in the object oriented world. It also maps 
very well to the Nodes abstraction used in the IDE (i.e. Nodes, Properties, 
Actions etc.). However representing the objects using only nodes has some
drawbacks. LooksAPI tries to solve these problems. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="2.1">2.1] Cooperation beween modules when creating visual 
represntation of an object</A></H3>
NetBeans architecture is based on allowing loosely coupled set of modules to
create an application. Although the modules should be designed to be as much 
independent as possible developers sometimes need to allow some level of 
cooperation of modules. Sharing a node which represents some object is example 
of such cooperation. (Currently in the NetBeans IDE the support for plain Java 
and supprt for working JavaBeans are two separated modules. However the JavaBeans
module needs to add it's own child node under the node representing a Java class.
this is impossible when using nodes only. Well, there is a way how to do it 
which only works for Java elements using using not very popular
<A HREF="@JAVA/SRCMODEL@/org/openide/src/nodes/FilterFactory.html">
Filter Factories</A>.)<BR>
Looks should allow such cooperation between any modules. Usual way how NetBeans
modules cooperate is through XML layers in the module jars. A module
can define a folder in the layer and other modules are allowed to add instances
of their classes into such folder. (The resulting content in folder is a merge
from instances in all modules.)<BR>
In order to be able to use this way of modules cooperation we need to switch
from the generalization based model in Nodes to a composition based model.
<A>CompositeLook</A> and <A>ProxyLook</A> are classes which allow for
the module cooperatin.<BR>
Notice that the Looks framework does not an can not solve the problem of 
what how exactly the Looks will cooperate. This is the responsibility of 
the module which provides the composition Look. So there can still be modules
which do not allow any other modules to modify the visualisation of their object
however some modules may expose such declarative API.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="2.2">2.2] Stronger separation of aspects when creating a node</A></H3>
The API of the Node class mixes many aspects of a node together. There are 
methods which affects the visual form of the node mixed with the methods for 
the managing node's internal state or children, firing events, support for drag and drop,
support for cut'n'paste etc. mixed together:

The only way developer would be  able to separate these aspects of nodes in 
order to allow some level of reuse would be designing his own classes and using 
delegation.<BR>
Looks API gives the developer a framework for developing different aspects 
separatley and composing them later with the possibility to share parts of
the implementation between different types of represented objects, in different 
Looks. Sipmle composition and filtering are one of the major advantages 
when using looks. Notice that when using filtering or composition the 
Looks framework will take care of composing and filtering the events fired from
the objects as well.

<H3><A NAME="2.3">2.3] Simplyfing event firing</A></H3>

Node was limited to fire only some changes in the underlying data. E.g. there
was no way how to fire change in the result of hasCustomizerMethod(). Also
all the firing methods were done as regular property changes i.e. there were
arguments for old and new value. This lead to the situatuin where some subclasses
had these methods implemented correctly an computed the values where some
implementations dir fire nulls instead.<BR>
In only the information is fired that something changed and the view has to
ask the Look for new values using regular Look methods. Event types are 
numbered rather than having separate methods. This allows for fireing more
changes at once. (E.g. it is possible to inform the view that the icon, opened
icon an name changed using one event istead of three)<BR>
This approach should allow views to handle events more effectively i.e. not 
to fire events from invisible objects, doing more updates at once. Decide
about suitable caching strategy for given view etc.

<H3><A NAME="2.4">2.4] Displaying only more aspects of object or more 
relationships between objects</A></H3>
Nodes are usually used to present the hierarchy of objects. This hierarchy
is usualy based on one kind of relationship between the represented objects.
Good example could be the hierarchy of Java classes and it's elements (e,g,
fields and methods. Currently in the IDE if you look at a Java class using int 
the explorer the hierarchy is given by containment (i.e. packages contain
Java classes, Java classes contain innerclasses, fields, constructors and 
methods). But it is true that the object describing  a Java source rather 
form a net than a tree. This can also be formulated so 
that the containment is not the only relationship which can be displayed for 
the Java sources. Other possible view of a Java class would show the supperclasses
and implemented interfaces of the class, yet another view would show the Java
class as a JavaBean with it's properties and event sources, different view
would show correctness of the Javadoc on the elements etc.<BR>
Looks allow to change is the fact that there is usually only one way how 
to look at the underlying data (object net). Just replace the word view from
the paragraph above with the word Look and allow switching look on given node
and you will get very flexible and rich viewer of the undelying object net.</LI>
<P>
<B>Notice</B>: Although this feature is implemented internaly there is currently
no API for changing look of a represented object.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="2.5">2.5] Misc improvements</A></H3>

The looks framework tryies not to remove any features which were available
in Nodes but it tryies to be more kind to the CPU and memory. So for example
when you still can chain looks as it was possible to chain FilterNodes 
the Looks framework saves listeners objects where possible. Also (as already 
mentioned in the paragraph 2.3) with some changes in the views ( and/or Nodes,
Children) classes there may be really siginificant memory consumption 
improvements achieved.
