<HTML><BODY>
A group is a cluster of aliases for files somehow related to each other. It is particularly useful if you
want to simultaneously work on files located in separate parts of the IDE. The template itself is empty.

<p>Once you create a group object from the template, you can fill it by pasting links from it to other files.
You can also save such a group as a new template.
<p>To add a file to a group, select an object in the Explorer you would like to add to the group and
choose <strong>Copy</strong> from the contextual menu. 
Then right-click on the group&#39;s node and choose <strong>Paste</strong> from 
the contextual menu.
