## This resource bundle is used for localized version of VSS. Translate this  ##
## only when the appropriate localization of VSS is available.                ##

# To translate this you will need to install the localized version of Visual
# Source Safe and fill the localized keys from the output of command-line commands.
# The user will have then two profiles available. One for original English VSS
# and one for localized VSS.


# Put the name of your locale instead of word "Localized" (i.e. "VSS - Japan").
VSS_Localized_Label=VSS - Localized

# Add a translated word "English" after these labels, so that the user will know,
# that this is for English VSS. (I.e. translate "VSS - English")
