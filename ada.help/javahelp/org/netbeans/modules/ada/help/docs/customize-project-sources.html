    <h2>
       Customizing the Project Settings: Sources</h2>
<p>
       <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Sources panel enables you to view the location of the project folder,
	manage source and test package folders, as well as set the source level of
	the packages which the IDE will use.
You open the Ada Project Properties dialog box by right-clicking 
  any and choosing Properties.
<!--explain source level?-->
</p>
<p>Use the buttons on the right side of the panel to add, remove, and change
  the order of classpath elements. 
<ul>
  <li>The source root cannot already exist in another IDE project.
  <li>The source root cannot already be added to another compilation unit of the same project. For example, a source root that is registered under Test Packages cannot be added to the list of Source Packages.
  <li>If you have a source root that needs to be used by several projects, you should create a separate project for the source root and set up compilation dependencies between the projects.
</ul>
<p><b>Test Packages Folders</b></p>
<p class="style1">THIS FEATURE IS NOT DEVELOPED</p>
<p>You can use this pane to specify the folder that the IDE uses when creating Ada Unit tests. 
  By default, when you create a project the IDE creates a test packages folder called <tt>test</tt> with the label Test Packages.
  Use the buttons to the right of the list to remove the selected folder or to specify the folder that the IDE uses when creating tests.
  You can also modify the Label field to change how the folder is displayed in the Projects window.</p>
<p>To create Ada Unit tests with the IDE, a project must have a test packages folder.
  If the test packages folder for your project is missing or unavailable, you can create a new folder in your project and 
  then use this pane to designate the new folder as the test packages folder.</p>
