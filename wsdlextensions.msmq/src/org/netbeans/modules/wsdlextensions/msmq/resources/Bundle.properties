DESC_Element_binding="binding" indicates a msmq protocol based binding.
DESC_ComplexType_tOperation="operation" defines the msmq protocol based operation binding details.
DESC_Element_message="Message" indicates a msmq protocol based operation message.
DESC_Attribute_connectionMode="Connection Mode" represents the mode of connection. "Queue Alias" is an Active Directory object of the MSMQ-Custom-Recipient class type, which associates an Ads path and a user-defined string (alias) with a public, private, or direct single-element format name.

Different types of format names can be used to  specify the way messages are routed, the type of destination, and the type of operation for which the queue is being opened. "Queue Name" in Message Queuing Server Name. "DistributionList" is a public list of destinations that are stored in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). "MulticastAddress" is the specific multicast address that a non-transactional Queue is associated with.  "MultipleElementFormatName" is created by concatenating any number of public format names, private format names, direct format names, including multicast address format names, and distribution list format names.
DESC_Attribute_destination="Destination" defines value of the queue name.
